All are\\nEqual.  None Is Favored.\\'  This was said with the assurance of an\\naphorism.  She said nothing as she found her other boot.  She sipped\\nlemyn juice from the dispenser as she cold-booted her boots; they\\nshuddered, purred and beeped as their diagnostic routines finished.\\n  `Okay.  Any more on my assignment?\\'\\n  `Nuh-uh.\\'\\n  `Sigh... okay, where did I leave my notepad?\\'\\n  `I think it\\'s under the heap of clothes next to the dryer.\\'  She\\nretrieved it, and tapped the function key to open a channel to the\\ntransport pool.\\n  `Single to the NoSan\\'No\\'Os ExPort by nine-thirty.\\'  While waiting\\nfor a response, she threw some more clothes in a mesh bag.  The\\nxenoform in the Transport department gurgled back at her, and a touch\\nof exasperation sharpened her tone.  `Is there anyone down there who\\nspeaks Anglic?\\'\\n  `Foogle.\\'  replied the xenoform.\\n  `Oh, line-noise.\\' she retorted.\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n  NoSan\\'No\\'Os:  (from \"Nos-a-Nos\", pre-reconciliation Scriptive,\\n                \"Circle within the Circle\") Dominant ruling\\n                bureaucracy controlling more than ninety thousand\\n                systems by virtue of monopoly on information,\\n                transport and energy-conversion technology.\\n\\n                            - Foley\\'s `Unofficial Documents\\'\\n\\n  She climbed into the transport through the roof-hatch and slid into\\nthe seat.  The driver said in a buzzing accent,\\n  `Of destination, be in state of definition.\\'  She replied,\\n  `NoSan\\'No\\'Os ExPort, and put some wings on it, hey?\\'  As she\\nbuckled the safety belt, the driver\\'s head rotated one hundred and\\neighty degrees, and she found herself looking into the faceted eyes\\nof something resembling a six-foot stick insect.\\n  `Of wings, be in state of indicating correct placement.\\'  it\\nchirred through its cheap translator.\\n  `Just drive, okay?  The NoSan\\'No\\'Os ExPort.\\'  The driver slowly\\nwaved its antennae, staring at her, and then turned back to the\\ncontrol column and instrument panel.  As the transport lifted from\\nthe ground and into the stream of AV traffic overhead, the driver hit\\na key on its heads-up array with a mandible, and the vehicle was\\nfilled with raucous mariachi music.  Gritting her teeth, Kelanie\\npaged through the Species ID section of her notepad, until she\\nidentified the driver as a lower-caste Kaelen.   Reading further:\\n\\n       `... when requesting respectful silence for the involved\\n       \"Hive Separation\" ritual, the Kaelen Queen emits a\\n       pheromone (scent chem.ref 976541) and emits a traditional\\n       \"cry of distress\" screech-tone (hear aud.ref 976537)\\'\\n\\n  She patched the audio reference through to her notepad, held it up\\nso that the point speaker was just behind the Kaelen\\'s backwards-\\npointing resonator-plate, and keyed it.  It played louder than she\\nexpected, and the transport almost fell out of the traffic stream as\\nthe Kaelen frantically chewed at the heads-up array controls.  The\\nmusic cut off in mid-trumpet-bray.\\n  `Of interpersonal relationships, being placed in situation of\\nobligation due to social error.\\'  She kept reading until she had\\nfinished the section on the Kaelen lower caste.\\n  When the transport had settled on the concrete pad at the southern\\nedge of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os ExPort, she climbed out and tapped the\\ndriver\\'s side window, which lowered with the grinding sound of\\npoorly-lubricated biotech fairings.\\n  `Of interpersonal relationship, emphasis! placed in situation of\\nobligation due to error.\\'  She held up her right hand, made a fist,\\nsplayed her fingers and said,\\n  `Of large-array social status, in state of adjusted obligation.\\',\\nwhich meant, in effect, that humanity was in some way indebted to the\\nKaelen and this exchange had mitigated that debt somewhat.  She\\nsmiled, and the Kaelen\\'s antennae flattened out.  She was impressed;\\nhere was a lower-caste xenoform that could interpret human facial\\nexpressions.  Most xenos didn\\'t bother.  This Kaelen was probably a\\nuniversity student.\\n  She strolled across the expanse of concrete, swinging the mesh bag,\\nshading her eyes from the morning sun with her forearm.  Apart from\\nthe control/customs bunker, the ExPort resembled a series of linked\\nconcrete ovals.   As she crossed the lower of six outer landing pads,\\nshe half-expected to see a cricket pitch set in the middle.\\n  She was met at the warehouse-sized door of the bunker by a boy who\\nappeared to be about twelve years old, wearing bright green shorts\\nand t-shirt, and skate-board pads on his knees.  He brushed aside a\\nwayward fringe of carrot-coloured hair, and waved to her.\\n  `Miss Camden?  Bureau of Procuration?  Hi, i\\'m Denkaster, Port\\nAdministrator.\\'  She followed him into the open-space office and took\\nthe seat he offered her.  `Do you have your medical records handy?\\'\\nhe asked, sorting through a pile of fiche plates on his cluttered\\ndesk.  She nodded, and touched the Match Fields key on her notepad,\\nwhich emitted the familiar `screeee\\' sound of notepads matching\\ncarrier frequencies.  While the notepads exchanged handshaking\\nsignals and then information, she asked,\\n  `Do you know where this transport is going?  after Syndaine, that\\nis?\\' Denkaster sighed, found the fiche he was looking for and\\nreplied,\\n  `\\'fraid not... you know the NoSan\\'No\\'Os, never tell us anything.\\nAlthough I do have some notes from your section head on Syndaine that\\nrelate to your assignment... your notepad should have them now.\\'  She\\nthanked him absently and started paging through file areas looking\\nfor the information, which had been, as usual, mis-keyed as\\n`corrections to existing documentation\\'.\\n\\n  Sitting in the departures lounge, Kelanie read the notes.  She was\\nexpected to travel to `Millimillenary\\' (a central exchange for\\npassengers of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os, ninety-five light years away), and to\\n`entertain\\' an executive of the Tendeysharhi, a species she had never\\nheard of.  In fact, her notepad had never heard of them either.\\n  `Wonderful.  How the hell am I supposed to work with a sentient\\nthat I\\'ve never seen before?\\'.  Reading on, she noted with rising\\nindignation that Starkey, her section head, expected her to interview\\nthe members of the Tendeysharhi entourage, with a view to picking up\\nthe proper etiquette and approach.  Angrily, she punched Starkey\\'s\\nphone number into her notepad.\\n  Starkey answered, though as usual, she employed video filters to\\nprevent anyone from identifying her.  In a weary voice, Kelanie\\nasked,\\n  `Okay, Robyn, what\\'s the big deal?  How am I supposed to make it\\nwith an alien that the Registry hasn\\'t even heard of?   Line-noise, I\\ndon\\'t even know if it\\'s an oxygen-breather!\\'\\n  `Kelanie, dearest... how are you?\\' Robyn\\'s filtered voice only just\\nmatched the aliased squares that represented her lips, and again\\nKelanie wondered if she was working for an artificial intelligence.\\nIf this was the case, Kelanie was not surprised that Starkey wanted\\nto keep it quiet, given the NoSan\\'No\\'Os\\' restrictions on\\nmachine-based consciousness.\\n  `I\\'m just a tad apprehensive about giving a blow-job to something\\nwhich may or may not have a dick, that\\'s all!\\'  Kelanie replied\\nsarcastically.   Robyn held up a hand, palm out.  It appeared as a\\nmass of pale pink squares on the display projected by Kelanie\\'s\\nnotepad.\\n  `I know, I know... this was dumped in my lap, and I don\\'t know any\\nmore about it than you, although we\\'re laying even money that it has\\nsomething to do with the Humanist faction in the Maracites-\\' Robyn\\nstopped when she saw the \"I don\\'t want to get drawn into another\\ntedious political argument\" expression on Kelanie\\'s face.  `- and...\\nwell, at the base level, it\\'s to seal a trade agreement with the\\nTendeysharhi.  What else can I say?\\'\\n  `You could tell me something about Millimillenary, for a start...\\nhave you ever been there?\\'  Kely thought she detected a smile on\\nRobyn\\'s face.\\n  `Once.  There are other humans there, I believe.  And despite what\\nyou\\'ve undoubtedly heard of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os, you won\\'t be treated\\nlike a sardine in a tin.  Their ships are often nearly empty, when\\nheading back towards the Centre.\\'  Kelanie tilted her head to one\\nside, staring at the surrealist image that her notepad was showing.\\n  `Robyn... what do you think about the NoSan\\'No\\'Os?\\'  This time, she\\nwas sure that Robyn smiled, before giving the Bureau salute (pressing\\nthe back of her hand to her lips) and hanging up.\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n <000077> requesting connection    ............\\n         connection established    connection established\\n\\n what do you want, 000077?

Looking out of the warehouse-sized doors, she noticed\\nthat the sky now appeared to be overcast.  However, sunlight glinted\\noff the metallic edges of a nearby building, and she saw signs of\\nactivity around her.  She stood, stretched, and sauntered over to the\\nnearest gate.  Outside and overhead, she could see the bottom of some\\nhuge curved shape, patterned like stained concrete, slowly sinking to\\nthe ground.  On the base of the ship, directly in line with the gate\\nshe stood in was an oval gap, about twice as wide as the gate,\\ncompletely dark, as if filled with black glass.  The glass appeared\\nto melt from the centre towards the edges, and stevedores began\\nshifting cargo trolleys.  They took care to avoid the short figures\\ndressed in dark grey that scuttled out on four legs from the rear of\\nthe ship\\'s cargo bay.  Kelanie knew them; Parkry, hive creatures who\\nmade up most of the administrative staff of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os.  One of\\nthem turned its blank, golden-eyed, mouthless face to her and\\nbeckoned with a three-jointed arm.  It didn\\'t wait to see if she\\nfollowed, merely turned and trotted back into the ship.\\n\\n  `This is it?\\' she peered into the round hatch, about a metre wide,\\nwith an expression of distaste.  The silent Parkry glanced at her\\nfrom underneath the brow of its curiously flattened head, pointed\\nagain, executed a 180-degree turn on its four stick-insect-like legs\\nand left.  She shrugged, hefted her mesh bag and climbed through.  It\\nwas smaller than her apartment; spherical, lined with something like\\ngrey foam rubber.  There was a faint smell of aphrodisia incense, as\\nif the berth had previously been occupied by Kabouter-hippies.  No\\nbed, datapoint or light-source, apart from the sodium glow that came\\nfrom the corridor.  She sat crosslegged in the middle of the floor,\\ntossed her mesh bag aside; it rolled down the curve of the room to\\nrest against her leg.  When she activated her notepad, she was\\nsurprised to find that the ship had a local data service, albeit a\\nlimited one, offering little more than expected departure time and a\\nsimple interactive map of the ship, with restricted areas marked by\\nthe NoSan\\'No\\'Os segmented circle-starburst symbol.  There were other\\nareas in this data service to explore, but she decided to leave them\\nalone for the moment, not through prudence in not disturbing the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os, but to leave her something to do during the trip, which\\nwould take between three and seven days, if the translation was\\naccurate.\\n  According to the info postings from this system, the ship was under\\nway, and had already left earth orbit.  She felt no acceleration or\\nother sense of motion; leaving her bag and fixing the berth\\'s\\nlocation in her backbrain, she decided to try and find a window.\\n  Robyn was right; the ship was almost deserted.  In ten minutes\\'\\nwandering through the series of corridors that radiated from a\\ncentral shaft, she only saw four Parkry, who scuttled by, tacitly\\nignoring her, and something like a six-legged Saint Bernard, which\\ncircled her while she stood stock-still, too cautious to make any\\npossibly offensive moves.  It stopped, looked up at her (this was the\\nimpression she got, though the xenoform lacked obvious visual organs)\\nand then ran off.  She breathed a deep sigh of relief, and then\\nstarted looking for a toilet.\\n  She allowed herself a slight measure of distress when she began to\\nsuspect that the Tertiary language didn\\'t even have a word that\\nrelated to the concept of `toilet\\'.  She eventually found a vague\\nreference to an organic recycling service and proceeded to the map\\nreference.  It was a room very much like her berth, lined with grey\\nsponge plastic, sealed with a weak field that contained the faint\\nodour of chemicals and containing a water-filled pit.  She wrinkled\\nher nose in distaste, but after assuring herself that she was alone,\\nproceeded to use the facilities.  She then made her way back to her\\nberth, with the firm intention of spending the rest of the trip in a\\nstate of low- metabolic-rate sleep.\\n\\n  When she got there, she found a large cat in her berth.\\n\\n  When she climbed in to the room, the moggy awoke immediately, fixed\\nits emerald gaze on her and put its ears back.  She froze.  It looked\\nlike a very tall, thin, wiry humanoid covered with thick, banded grey\\nfur and with strangely jointed legs.  And a tail, which was now\\nslowly lashing to and fro behind it.  There were fluffy tufts of\\nwhite fur poking out of its ears, and a mat of similar fur running\\ndown its chest.  It yowled something, to which her notepad could only\\nbeep apologetically; fortunately, it had its own translator, which\\nsnarled something like `Anyhah-araha eiyaha\\' at her, followed by some\\nsort of insectoid chittering.  She spoke to the xenoform\\'s\\ntranslator.\\n  `Terrestrial Anglic, thank you.\\'  The translator, shaped something\\nlike a flattened bottle, made some purring noises, and then said in\\nAnglic,\\n  `My room, my territory.  I was here first.  Mine.\\'  She pointed to\\nher bag, which the xeno had apparently opened and gone through,\\nspreading her clothes over the floor of the berth.\\n  `My bag.  My property.  It was here before you were, my claim to\\nthis territory.\\'  The xeno narrowed its eyes and growled softly.  She\\ncontinued, `I will call a Parkry, they will decide -\\' the xeno\\nyowled, and the translator interrupted hastily.\\n  `No, no, I am content to share.  I will sleep in the middle.  Do\\nnot make excessive noise or excrete on the floor.\\'  She was about to\\nsay something like \"well, just who the hell do you think you are,\\nbuster?\" when she remembered previous experiences with alien language\\ntranslators, and she kept her silence.  The Xenoform curled up into a\\ncompact ball, lashed its tail around it and closed its eyes warily.\\nShe sighed, and carefully lay down beside it, smiling bemusedly when\\nshe heard it start to purr.  She composed herself and began the\\nmental exercises to prepare for a period of extended sleep.  She\\nslowed her breathing, inserted some links into her sub-conscious to\\nawaken her if her notepad should sound an alarm for any reason, and\\nthen drifted off into a deep, dreamless sleep.\\n  She woke to find that the xeno had shifted and was sleeping with\\nits forepaws across her hips, its head against the small of her back.\\nThe soft purring had deepened to a husky `brrr\\', and she woke fully\\nwhen it gently butted its head against her back and made a small\\n`riowr\\' sound.  She tried to turn without moving her body from the\\nshoulders down, an d could see one large paw, the size of a tennis\\nraquet, with three-centimetre-long claws extending and sheathing\\nreflexively, making tiny indentations in the bare flesh of her hip.\\nProceeding with caution, she took the paw in her free hand and gently\\nlifted it.  The claws quivered, and then extended to their full five\\ncentimetres, clutching her hip in their broad span, the points of the\\nclaws sinking in a few millimetres.\\n  `Excuse me.\\' she murmured.  The xeno\\'s translator ignored her.\\n`HEY!\\' she shouted.  The xenoform awoke with a start, digging its\\nclaws further into her hip.  She twitched, but remained where she\\nwas.\\n  `Take your paw off me.\\'  The xeno\\'s translator paused for a long\\nmoment, and then yowled at the xeno in its native language.  The xeno\\nsheathed its claws, flicked its ears back momentarily, and curled up\\nagain, excluding her from its personal space.  She turned over,\\nclosed her eyes and composed herself for sleep again; within half an\\nhour, the xeno had its paw on her hip again, whereupon the ywent\\nthrough the same procedure; and again some two hours after that,\\nafter which she gave up and went to sleep in the passageway.\\n\\n  She regained consciousness two days later, to visit the toilet\\nagain.  She slowly stretched, licked her dry lips, and then noticed\\nthe xeno sitting curled up at her feet, like a doormat patterned in\\ngrey stripes, outside the berth.  It was gazing at her intently.  It\\nyowled, and its translator said,\\n  `You sleep.  Why?\\'\\n  `No food.  Little water.  Not hungry when asleep.\\' The xeno\\'s ears\\nflattened when the translator reported this.  It uncurled from its\\nstation at her feet, entered the berth (on all fours), and emerged\\nwith a bloody haunch of raw meat in its jaws.  She went pale, and\\nbacked away slightly when the xeno offered it to her.  It regarded\\nher with an air of obvious surprise for a moment, waggled its ears\\nand then tore into the meat itself, keeping a wary eye on her.\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n       `The Tendeysharhi are a classic example of parallel\\n        evolution, in that they resemble, superficially, large\\n        felines, and many feline traits, including an acute sense\\n        of territoriality, feline language structure (which tends\\n        towards subtly-intoned yowls and screeches) and a\\n        tendency to shed large amounts of fur at certain times of\\n        the year.  The females are noticeably more violent and\\n        territorial than their mates.  The Tendeysharhi did not\\n        develop a science sufficient to begin space exploration\\n        on their own; they were `apprenticed\\' to the Moridani\\n        before the Purge, and were allowed to join the\\n        NoSan\\'No\\'Os as a subject race after it.\\'\\n\\n          - Martini Baton, `What the Hell is THAT?\\', Chapter Five\\n\\n  The hatch melted away, and a breeze wafted into the entry hold,\\ncarrying with it the strange fragrance of another world.  The light\\nhad a golden-bronze hue to it; the sky faded from a pale gold\\ndirectly overhead to a curious yellow-green at the horizon.  It\\nreminded her of the patina found in the folds of old bronze statues.\\nThe sounds of dozens of different languages overlaid and formed\\ncounterpoint to the squeaks, pops, mellifluous surging chords and\\ncrashes of alien music.  The air pressure seemed a bit higher than\\nearth\\'s; the gravity a bit less.  There was definitely a higher\\noxygen content in the air, and she felt giddy as she danced down the\\nexit ramp, resisting the temptation to swing her mesh clothes-bag.\\nThe cat-like xenoform raced past her on all fours, yowling as if its\\ntail were on fire, and vanished into the crowd of Parkry who were\\nrushing to get on board the ship.  She ploughed a furrow through them\\nand made her way to the customs hut, a pale blue geodesic dome with\\nthree triangular archways cut into it.  Her giddiness was tempered by\\nthe sight of dozens of tall Plateau Bythians casually lounging around\\nthe ExPort, all of them toting dull grey plastic weapons.  She\\nentered the dome, and felt the itchy tickling feeling that\\naccompanied mass-spectronometric scanning as she passed through the\\ndoorway.  No immediately obvious alarms went off, so she assumed that\\nthe devices she posessed were within current NoSan\\'No\\'Os levels of\\nacceptability.  She\\'d heard nasty stories of people who had tried to\\ncommute just before the last Purge, when the standard of Interdicted\\ntechnology had been dropped while they were carrying things like\\nempathic personality emulators and nano-gated NeuralNet arrays.\\n  She set her translator to `NoSan\\'No\\'Os Tertiary\\', the language used\\nto communicate with subject races (of which humanity was one), and\\nentered the dome.  There was a queue, but it was leading in the other\\ndirection, from the other side of the ExPort and into the ship.  A\\nsmaller-than-average Parkry was propped next to a data-post, holding\\na vocoder hand-set and waving at her.  She went over and sat before\\nthe xenoform, crossing her legs.  The Parkry massaged the hand-set,\\nand the data-post said something in Tertiary.  Her notepad\\'s\\ntranslator responded immediately:\\n  `Query: Full Name.  Origin.  Purpose for visit.\\'\\n  `Kelanie A\\'liiya Camden, Earth, Diplomatic Exchange.\\'  At this, the\\nParkry glanced over from the holographic output from the data-post.\\nIt squeezed the hand-set, keeping its glittering eyes on her.  More\\nTertiary.\\n  `Expression of interest, your reference: Diplomatic Exchange.\\nQuery: Which Bureau.\"  She sighed, safe in the knowledge that the\\ntranslator would ignore it, and replied,\\n  `Bureau of Procuration.\\'  The Parkry seemed to lose interest.  It\\ngave her a plastic bracelet, studded with a pattern of metallic dots,\\nand the data-post played a recorded message, in flat, unaccented\\nAnglic:\\n  `This clothing is your identification while you are staying on\\nMillimillenary.   Do not lose it, sell it or exchange it for\\ninterdicted technology.  You will not be allowed to leave the planet\\nwithout it.  It is resistant to all chemicals and temperatures above\\'\\n(here, the post made a sound like a poorly-tuned radio), `and below\\'\\n(a sound like a bass-pitched dog\\'s whine).  `Please note: it is not\\nresistant to thermonuclear, fusion or ComonCurensy isotope detonation\\nabove the thirty megaton range.  Put it on now.\\'  The Parkry was\\nwatching her again, so she wrapped it around her left wrist and\\npressed the ends together, which melded to form a single piece.\\n`This clothing can only be removed by an authorised agent of the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os, on your departure from Millimillenary.\\'  The interview\\nappeared to be over.  She stood up, and wandered towards an exit,\\nwhere small groups of Parkry were still queueing for departure\\nprocessing.  She fished the video-eyepiece (which she had not used\\nsince she last visited Japan) from a pouch in her bag and put on the\\nheadband, the eyepiece hanging over her left eye like a pirate\\'s\\neyepatch.  It made a tiny `peep\\' noise as it matched carriers with\\nher notepad, and the view through the eyepiece blurred momentarily.\\nOne by one, as the processor in her notepad identified and translated\\nthem, various signs written in Tertiary were marked and translations\\nwere appended in the eyepiece\\'s view.  She spotted a data-post marked\\n`Free Information for the Newcomer\\' and went over to it.  She spoke\\nto her notepad;\\n  `Excuse me?  I need information.\\'  The data-post made pretty\\nholographic moire patterns to indicate that it was thinking, and then\\nreplied, in Anglic,\\n  `Please be more specific.\\'\\n  `I need to locate food, water and a place to sleep.  I also need to\\nlocate other humans on Millimillenary, if there are any.\\'  Another\\npause, more moire-patterns, and then,\\n  `Food and water for humans can be obtained from the Human Embassy,\\nat LFFRE-77153.  No information regarding requirements for,\\' and it\\nquoted her words, playing a sample of her saying \"a place to sleep\",\\n`is available.  You will find other humans at the Embassy.\\'  It\\ndisplayed a map (which looked like it might have been designed by\\nPiet Mondrian).  Her notepad translated the text, and if she was any\\njudge of distance, the Embassy appeared to be about seven hundred\\nkilometres away from the ExPort.\\n  `Are there any places matching my requirements, closer to the\\nExPort?  If so, please list the five closest, and the distance to\\nthem.\\'  Another pause, and then:\\n  `There are three.  \"Maracite Information Exchange Registry\",\\nLFFRB-77151, six hundred and ninety-three blocks from here to there,\\n\"Church of the SubGenius\", LLFRB-77122, six hundred and fifty-one\\nblocks from here to there,\\' - another pause - \\'\"Waddell\\'s Emporium of\\nExtremely Fashionable Attire and Quite Nice Ice Cream Parlour\",\\nNRNAL-10021, two blocks from here to there.\\'  These three were\\nrepresented by tiny red inverted `A\\'s on the map, two of them close\\nto the Embassy, the ice-cream parlour so close to the ExPort that it\\nappeared almost to be on the same block.  She took a snapshot of the\\nmap with her notepad, expanded it until she could see enough details\\nto find the ice-cream parlour and left the dome.\\n  Millimillenary appeared to be completely covered by city-scape, the\\nentire habitable surface of the planet divided up into a grid, with\\nbuildings that reached up for about fifty storeys, providing a third\\ndimension that the map wasn\\'t required to show.  The streets were\\nbased in pale concrete, paved with slippery white ceramic plates, and\\nwould have been rather drab and utilitarian if it wasn\\'t for the\\nhundreds of different xenoforms who streamed up and down them.  There\\nappeared to be a large single lane of foot-traffic (or at least what\\npassed for feet on some beings) moving in one direction, and two\\nsmaller lanes on either side, moving in the other direction.  This\\ntended to work to the disadvantage of the sentients who were on the\\noutside lanes, and it became apparent that it was often easier to\\ntravel three or four blocks out of your way, just to use the quicker\\ninner lane.  In places, she saw what appeared to be short grey trees,\\nbare of leaves, the branches dividing into three from the base,\\nprogressively sub-dividing to a mass of thread-like tips.  She\\nreached out to stroke a branch which was about the thickness of her\\nlittle finger, and it writhed away from her touch.\\n  Waddell\\'s shop occupied the entire ground floor of one block; the\\noutside was a mass of holographic signs in dozens of languages,\\nincluding Anglic, Russic Europan and Katakana.  There were beeps,\\nsqueaks and hums that she recognised as signs for xenoforms that\\ndidn\\'t have a visual sense.  She spent a few minutes looking for a\\ndoor, found one (concealed within a hologram of a two-metre-tall\\nchocolate sundae - her mouth was watering already) and entered.\\n  The ice-cream parlour was located in the centre of the store, with\\nthe clothing displays surrounding it.  The clothes looked like\\ntheatrical costumes - surely, no-one wore Elizabethan ruffs these\\ndays!  She began to think that this store catered more for xenoforms\\nwho wanted to dress up than for actual humans.  She wondered why she\\nhadn\\'t thought to ask the data-post at the ExPort exactly how many\\nhumans there were on Millimillenary.  At least the music was\\nterrestrial - early Robert Smith.\\n  There was a dejected-looking young man with short dark hair sitting\\nbehind the counter.  He was cleaning a small metal part from a\\nblender that was disassembled around him.  A xeno that resembled a\\nmetre-tall kiwi-bird hopped up on to the counter and said,\\n  `Reeee? Reeeeeeee?\\'  He took a glazed cherry from a bowl nearby and\\ntossed it to the xeno, which caught it with the end of its long,\\nflexible snout and jumped off.  She approached the counter, and with\\nan audible `click\\', turned off her notepad.  The young man froze.\\n  `Excuse me, i\\'d like to order a chocolate s-\\' he looked up, and\\nalmost fell off the stool he was perched on.  He leaped off the\\nstool, dropping the part he was cleaning, rushed over and grabbed her\\nshoulders.   He stared into her face with a disturbing intensity.\\n  `Are... are you a human?\\'  He was trembling.\\n  `Yes... why?  You seem rather upset.\\'  His eyes grew wide, and a\\nlook of hysterical disbelief appeared.\\n  `Upset... upset, she says.  My god!  You are only the third human\\nbeing that I have seen in seven years! UPSET!!!\\' he began to laugh\\nhysterically.  She broke free from his grasp, and grabbed him by the\\nfront of his shirt.  He kept laughing, eyes squeezed shut, and she\\nwas obliged to slap him.  He stopped abruptly, gasping, face almost\\nwhite except for a red palm-print, staring at her in shock.  `I\\'m\\nsorry.\\'  he whispered, turning and stumbling back to the counter,\\npicking up the polishing-rag as he went.  It was then that she\\nnoticed a chain bolted around his ankle.  She rushed after him,\\ncatching his arm and spinning him around to face her again.  He\\nrefused to meet her gaze, so she took his chin in her hand and lifted\\nhis face.  He closed his eyes and tried to struggle free.  She threw\\nher arm around his shoulder, drew him close and pressed her lips to\\nhis.  After a moment\\'s hesitation, he responded, returning her\\nattention hungrily.  His hands slipped around her waist, hugging her\\nto him intently, slowly forcing her back onto the counter.  She let\\nhim proceed, wondering what sort of circumstance could put someone in\\na position where he had to live apart from his own people for so\\nlong.\\n  She got the story out of him eventually.  His name was Marek, and\\nhis great-grandparents had started this venture out, just over a\\nhundred years ago, when the NRNAL-10021 district was still under\\ndevelopment.  As the district became less local- and more tourist-\\noriented, the business prospered to the point where they owned the\\nentire block, right up to the fiftieth floor; at this point, they had\\nattracted the attention of a sub-set of the Parkry, who demanded a\\ncut of the profits.  When Marek\\'s grandparents had refused, they had\\nbeen denounced to the NoSan\\'No\\'Os as possible technocrats, in the\\nemploy of the Interdicted Moridani, and had been banished.  Marek\\'s\\nparents, too young to join his grandparents in exile,  had been\\nindentured to a local Information Trader, who had taken over the\\nbusiness (after assuring the Parkry that they would get their cut).\\n  `... which, as I rapidly learned, was the way things were done\\naround here.  Still are, in fact.\\'  Marek fell silent.  Kelanie\\nhugged him again.\\n  `What I can\\'t understand is they would put you into such menial,\\nmind-numbing labour as this, when you would be more useful to them in\\nan -\\' he glanced up at her.\\n  `- administrative position?\\' He scowled.  `Kelanie, this entire\\nplanet is knee-deep in bureaucrats.  I could spend several lifetimes\\nhere, gradually moving up the ranks, and one day, maybe, MAYBE, I\\nwould get to a position where I could filch a packet of blank memory\\ncartridges.  Maybe.\\'  Kelanie was silent.  Marek hadn\\'t yet realised\\nhow high up in the structure her position was.\\n  There was an awkward pause, during which Marek absently polished an\\nalready-gleaming spoon.  Kelanie\\'s stomach broke the silence with the\\nsort of gurgle you\\'d get from not eating for three days.  She glanced\\nlongingly at the array of ice-cream-like substances; Marek glanced at\\nher apologetically, and then rushed to prepare a `Waddell Special\\'\\nfor her.\\n  After sharing the large sundae with him, she asked if there was\\nsomewhere she could sleep, and Marek pointed to a pile of hessian-\\nlike sacks in an alcove, evidently his home.  The chain from his leg\\nwas fixed to a point next to a small wash-trough from which water\\ngurgled quietly.  There were a few holograms pasted on the wall, and\\na small audio player.  She took him by the hand and led him over to\\nhis bed.\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n       `If that\\'s the way it looks, then it probably is, but I\\n        would be tempted to take it apart anyway, just to be\\n        sure.\\'\\n\\n              Aln Riker, from `Riker\\'s Defense\\', NoSan\\'No\\'Os\\n              Interdiction Trial Records\\n\\n  She woke a few hours later, with a sore throat from the sharp\\noxygen-rich air.  Marek was hugging her as if he were afraid that\\nshe\\'d escape.  She idly stroked his cheek, smiling.  It wasn\\'t often\\nthat she had the time, or the inclination, for such recreational\\nactivity in her position.  The intensity of the emotion Marek had\\nrevealed after his isolation touched her deeply, and she began\\nturning various schemes around in her mind, with a view to releasing\\nhim from his servitude.\\n  Marek noticed the bracelet she had received at the Millimillenary\\nExPort.\\n  `What did you do to deserve that?\\'\\n  `The Parkry at the ExPort gave it to me when I arrived... what do\\nyou mean, \"deserve it\"?  Marek stroked the pattern of raised metallic\\ndots.\\n  `It looks like the markers that the NoSan\\'No\\'Os place on crates of\\ninterdicted technology... I think it\\'s an identifier for possible\\ncriminal activity, sort of like a warning... it means that if you\\nwere arrested, you\\'d be taken to the Office of Threat Termination\\nimmediately, no questions asked.\\'\\n  `Threat Termination?  That sounds a bit extr-\\' Suddenly, a voice,\\nspeaking in Anglic, called out from the main counter.\\n  `Waiter?  Way-y-te-r-r!!!!\\'  She was mildly surprised to recognise\\nthe voice - it belonged to a pre-millennium video actor, Rik Mayall.\\nShe turned over, and peered at the counter.  She couldn\\'t see\\nanything there, but the voice called out again, in exactly the same\\ntones.  She suspected that it was being generated by a digital\\nsampler.  She got up, draped some loose bedding material around her\\nshoulders, but after realising that there were very few xenoforms on\\nMillimillenary that would be offended by a naked human, she draped\\nthe cloth over Marek instead and went over to the counter, taking her\\nnotepad just in case `waiter, waiter\\' was the alien\\'s complete Anglic\\nvocabulary.  Looking over the counter, she saw something like a\\nswollen turtle shell, almost two metres long and a metre tall.  She\\ncould see her reflection in the smooth, glossy black surface; the\\nshell was completely featureless, not even a sign of feet, wheels or\\nother methods of propulsion - it seemed to slide along the ground by\\nsheer willpower.  She felt a faint tickling sensation behind her\\nbreastbone as the xeno turned to face her, probably caused by some\\nsort of sonar-based sense.  The xeno spoke again, employing another\\naudio sample, a very old one judging from the degree of noise that\\naccompanied it:\\n  `Where\\'s our fish?  We\\'ve finished our fish!\\'  Kelanie was paging\\nthrough her notepad\\'s Species ID files, which had been greatly\\naugmented by access to the local data service; this alien lacked a\\nname that could be easily represented in human terms, and was simply\\ndenoted by the code `N-SVW-Tre/A\\'.  There was a Tertiary language\\ninterface available, so she patched it in and spoke to it.\\n  `How may I serve you?\\'  The notepad converted her expression to\\nTertiary, and from there to N-SVW-Tre/A, which sounded like a wavery\\ncockatoo screech which rose in volume and then faded again.\\nApparently, the N-SVW-Tre/A\\'s natural communication took place on a\\nfrequency higher than human hearing, because the translator returned\\nits response after a short pause, during which all Kelanie heard was\\nthe faint jingling and crashing of the music.\\n  `I had thought you incapable of sarcasm, Marek.  (carriage return\\nline feed).  Have you been taking lessons behind my back? (carriage\\nreturn line feed).  And from which of our worthy customers did you\\nsteal that instrument?  (carriage return line feed).  I believe that\\nit is high on the NoSan\\'No\\'Os Interdiction list, if it is what it\\nappears to be, and if you continue to point it at me, I will have you\\nbeaten.  (end of file).\\'\\n  What an asshole, (carriage return line feed), Kelanie thought.\\nMarek rushed up, pulling on a pair of pants, and threw himself down\\nin front of the xeno, kneeling, arms thrust back, forehead almost\\ntouching the floor.  Acting on instinct, Kelanie started a\\nholographic recording, sure that Marek\\'s employer was about to give a\\ngraphic example of how poorly it treated him.  The tickling feeling\\nwavered, as if the xeno was having trouble distinguishing between\\nthem; it finally oriented towards Marek, edged closer to him and\\nsuddenly lashed out with a club-like flipper, hitting Marek on the\\nside of the head and almost knocking him down.  Kelanie watched,\\nrestraining herself; the holographic recording clearly showed blood\\nrunning from a deep scratch on Marek\\'s forehead.  The xeno turned to\\nleave, and Kelanie nodded, stopping the recording.  After finding a\\nparticularly cutting insult in the N-SVW-Tre/A\\'s relation-table, she\\nstepped over and delivered a solid kick to the rear end of the xeno\\'s\\nshell, pushing the alien across the floor into a cluster of\\nhat-stands, one of which fell over.  The xeno shuddered like a\\nstalled motor-vehicle for a moment, and then seemed to regain its\\ncomposure, turning to face her like an armoured tank.  She felt the\\ntickling feeling definitely as the blank curved turtle shape surged\\ntowards her.  Marek grabbed her arm and whispered,\\n  `Come on, don\\'t make things any worse than they -\\' She held out her\\nnotepad and thumbed the `Send\\' key.  It gave out a short screech that\\nstopped the N-SVW-Tre/A in its tracks.  There was a moment of\\nsilence, during which even the background music seemed to quieten.\\nKelanie felt the tickling feeling waver as the xeno hesitantly looked\\nher over.  It hissed, and her notepad translated.\\n  `Confirm. (carriage return line feed)\\'  She smiled grimly, typed\\nher response, sent the translation.  It was so quiet that she could\\nhear Marek breathing behind her.  The xeno\\'s response must have been\\nhighly emotional, as it was carried on a sound-wave that was well in\\nthe supersonic range... the translator caught it, though:\\n  `Such transactions are not covered by NoSan\\'No\\'Os Code. (carriage\\nreturn line feed).  You must offer a minimum amount to allow a tax to\\nbe levied on the exchange. (end of file).\\'  She popped a dull\\nmetallic sphere out of plastic bubble-pack she had been given at the\\nEarth ExPort, and tossed it to the floor in front of the xeno, which\\nscrambled after it and then turned to leave.  As it trundled away,\\nshe felt the tickling feeling intensify, almost to the point of an\\nache, which suddenly cut off as the N-SVW-Tre/A passed through the\\nexit.\\n  `Marek?\\' He had vanished.  She followed the chain that had looped\\naround one of the stools mounted behind the counter, and led to the\\nMillimillenarian equivalent of a broom cupboard.  Marek was crouched\\ninside, with a piece of recycled hessian paper-cloth pressed against\\nthe cut on his forehead, his eyes squeezed shut.  `Marek, you can\\ncome out now.  It\\'s safe.\\'\\n  `He\\'s going to kill me.  He\\'s going to come back and kill me and\\ncut me up and feed the pieces to his children.  He said that he\\'d do\\nthat one day if I ever got out of line.\\'  Kelanie knelt down next to\\nMarek, putting her arms around him.\\n  `He won\\'t.  He can\\'t, because I bought you from him.  In fact, I\\nbought the whole enterprise.\\'  Marek opened his eyes and stared at\\nher.\\n  `You couldn\\'t have.  I doubt that anyone on Earth has enough money\\nto buy this property - what did you say to him?\\'\\n  `I reminded him of a sub-section of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os Code, the part\\nregarding proper treatment of equipment and subject races, and I told\\nhim that if the InterSpecies Advisory group saw this recording I\\'d\\nmade, that he and his entire species could be deported as a possible\\n`Risk Of Violent Species\\' classification.  I then offered my word as\\n\"a Human\" that I\\'d erase the recording if he sold you to me... and he\\ncouldn\\'t sell you unless he sold the shop as well. Marek\\'s face fell\\nslightly.\\n  `So, you\\'re my owner now.\\'\\n  `No!  I\\'m not even your employer - bureau associates aren\\'t allowed\\nto have anything to do with the private sector.  I\\'ll have to sign\\nthe entire thing over to you.\\'  She smiled.  Marek got up.\\n  `First thing we have to do, is sell it.  My master - my old master-\\nis probably off right now to find some mercenary Pthalklin Ervae that\\nhe can pay to torch the place, that\\'s the way their minds work...  I\\nknow a few factors who\\'d be interested in this property.\\'  He moved\\nover to the telephone, keyed the contact panel.  Some words appeared\\nin angular Tertiary script, which her eyepiece translated as `Finding\\nFree Data Channel: Please Wait\\'.  They waited, Marek tapping his\\nfingers impatiently on the console.  More letters appeared on the\\nscreen:\\n\\n       While You <approx> Are Waiting:  Concern <approx> is\\n       experienced by your government\\'s Technological Control\\n       Bureau when rumors/unconfirmed reports <approx> appear,\\n       indicating that the Technological Interdict is not being\\n       taken seriously <approx>.  Remember: only you <approx> can\\n       prevent thermonuclear devastation on a wide scale.\\n\\n  Kelanie was incredulous.\\n  `Government propaganda!  They never stop, do they... I wonder how\\nthe NoSan\\'No\\'Os Bureaucracy has managed to stay together for this\\nlong... I thought that bureaucracy was one of the least inherently\\nstable forms of government.\\'  Suddenly, the telephone screen cleared,\\nand a voice spoke in Anglic:\\n  `Human Bureaucracy is inherently unstable.  NoSan\\'No\\'Os Bureaucracy\\nis not founded on greed and the inherently human sense of blind\\nself-importance.  This message was brought to you by the office of\\nMillimillenarian Technological Control.\\'  Marek smiled at this, and\\nwhen he caught Kelanie giving him a quizzical look, he said,\\n  `They\\'re always listening... it\\'s just as well you didn\\'t say\\nanything really inflammatory, otherwise,\\' (the \\'phone pinged, and the\\n`call open\\' message flashed up) `those Ervae that my ex-master is\\nhiring would find a big hole in the ground here when they came to\\ntorch the shop.  Anyway, your call is always put through just after\\none of those little messages... you just have to be careful that you\\ndon\\'t say something too inflammatory.\\'  Marek addressed the telephone\\nin flawless Tertiary, and a bizarre psychedelic pattern appeared on\\nthe screen, oscillating and flashing through hundreds of glowing\\ncolours.  Kelanie got the impression of two twisted toroids\\nintertwined in mid-air.  Marek asked,\\n  `Keery?  Nur-wah Marek, Keery!\\' Whatever-it-was chattered in\\nhollow-sounding, oddly-modulated Tertiary, to which Marek rapidly\\nreplied, speaking over the translation that Kelanie\\'s notepad\\nsupplied, going too fast for it to keep up.  The thing pulsed bright\\ngreen three times; Marek held up five fingers; it pulsed blue-green\\nfour times; Marek held up four fingers with his thumb bent over; the\\nthing flashed orange, red and a piercing hot pink colour, and the\\nimage disappeared as it broke the connection.  Marek stood there for\\na few moments, eyes wide, a faint smile on his face.  Kelanie left\\noff fiddling with the notepad\\'s playback, and asked him,\\n  `Keery?\\'\\n  `Kireedeonibalikathadamiax.\\'\\n  `Well? Did you sell it? How much did you get for it?\\' When he\\ndidn\\'t answer, she nudged him and repeated the question.\\n  `Oh?  Yeah, she bought it...\\' He went over to the counter and\\nstarted rummaging around underneath, looking for something.  She\\nmoved over to join him, shifting boxes as he dragged them out from\\nunderneath the counter.\\n  `Well?  Come on, Marek, don\\'t be a tease - how much?\\'  Marek found\\nwhat he was looking for - a spherical yellow-glass bottle filled with\\nclear brown fluid - popped the cap off took a long swig and said:\\n  `Four and one half CCi.\\'  He suddenly sat on the floor, grimacing\\nat the taste of the fluid.\\n  `CCi?\\'\\n  `ComonCurensy Isotope.  It\\'s the official medium of exchange on all\\nthe NoSan\\'No\\'Os Civilised Systems - don\\'t you know anything?\\'\\n  `Well, apparently, the NoSan\\'No\\'Os don\\'t consider Earth civilised\\nyet... that\\'s the first I\\'ve ever heard of - what was it?\\' Marek got\\nup, went over to the platform-cash register mounted into the counter,\\nand retrieved a note from the cash tray.  He held it out to her.\\n  `ComonCurensy Isotope.  It\\'s a form of sheet-carbon TCI, in an-\\'\\n  `TCI?\\'\\n  `Total Conversion Isotope, in an easy-to-fuse format; the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os are generally energy-based when it comes to currency.\\nEarth is still trying to make information-based currency work, aren\\'t\\nthey?\\'  She nodded, examining the note.\\n  `We may be locked into the idea of an economy based on barter, but\\nat least we don\\'t use this sort of thing anymore.\\'  She held out her\\nwrist, revealing the silver button contact of her Work-Credit- Hour\\nmeter.  Marek took back the note, replacing it in the till from force\\nof habit.\\n  `This is the largest bill we have - that\\'s a \"Five by ten to the\\npower of minus twelve\" CCi note.\\'  He noted her expression, and\\ngrinned.  `Yeah... I remember once that the entire human solar system\\n- all the planets and their resources - was once priced at twenty\\nCCi.\\'  Kelanie tried to compare that to a recent estimate of the\\nsolar system\\'s worth in Human terms, and gave up, settling for the\\napproximation that Marek was probably richer than anyone she\\'d ever\\nmet before - in fact, richer than anyone on Earth.\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n  `...and you\\'ve never seen one?\\'\\n  `I don\\'t think so, no... all I have is the name: \"Tendeysharhi\",\\nand the Species ID N-FRF-Bla/G.  Mind you, I haven\\'t had a really\\ngood look through the local data service yet - I find myself\\ncontinually interrupted...\\' she smiled at him.  They were exploring\\nthe city, looking for somewhere to stay while Kelanie completed her\\nmission.  This was the first time Marek had been outside the shop\\nsince his indenture, sixteen years ago, and he was just as bewildered\\nas she.  They had followed the grid pattern until they came up\\nagainst a huge, blank curved wall which cut smoothly through the\\nstreets and buildings.  They had back-tracked around the blocks,\\ncoming up against this wall each time, and had made no progress for\\nabout an hour when they decided to stop at something resembling a\\nstreet cafe and sort out their next move.\\n  Marek ordered iced tea (the only terrestrial thing on the `Seff\\nCafe\\' menu) while Kelanie tried to sort out the indexing system used\\nby the local data service.\\n  `This is strange, it\\'s like a binary tree, but it has branches\\ngoing both ways...\\'  Kelanie gave up looking for a map that she could\\nunderstand without requiring severe modifications to the structure of\\nher brain, and started tracing N-FRF-Bla/G in the Species ID section.\\nShe found it, right next to \"N-FRF-Knh/K\" - which was the code for\\nHumanity; it was that cat-like alien she had met onboard the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os transport.\\n  `Crash it,\\' she murmured, `that xeno could have been the one I was\\nsupposed to meet.\\'  Something had come over to them and was trying to\\ncommunicate, tweaking its translator.  It had a small, rounded body\\nperched on long, stilt-like legs, a pair of small hands held up in\\nfront like a kangaroo\\'s; a large domed head with four tiny red eyes\\nset more or less evenly at the front, a wide, lipless grinning mouth,\\nand no neck.  Its translator said something, some of which Kelanie\\'s\\nnotepad could understand: \"Undefined - Undefined - Haircut? -\\nUndefined.\"  She grinned at Marek.  `A Xenoform barber! Do you think\\nI need a haircut?\\'  The alien bent at the knees, bowing and smirking.\\nMarek was earnestly trying to help the xenoform fine-tune its\\ntranslator when Kelanie spotted a familiar feline form slinking into\\na building across the street.  She grabbed Marek\\'s arm excitedly,\\ndragging him away from the cafeteria and the dome-headed xeno.  She\\npressed up against the clear plastic of the office-space across the\\nroad from the cafeteria, just as a massive explosion rocked the\\nstreet, pieces of debris from the cafe clattering against the\\nsheet-plastic next to them.  There was a brief space of silence,\\nfollowed by a wierd cacophony of alien moans and hoots of distress.\\nThe air was soon thick with the buzz and click of translators,\\noverlaid with tinkling bell-like tones - sirens that signalled the\\narrival of the Bythian Militia who were soon swarming over the site\\nlike insects from a hive that had been attacked.   Kelanie spotted\\nthe barber striding away on its improbably long legs, tucking\\nsomething into a spherical satchel.  She dragged Marek into the\\noffice-space, glancing about for a doorway out of the front-\\ndesk/screening area that the feline xeno could have taken.\\n  A datapost was mounted into what passed for an enquiries desk.\\nKelanie approached it, tugging Marek (who was still trying to see\\nwhat was going on across the street) with her.\\n  `Where are we?\\' she asked the datapost, which displayed the usual\\n\"please wait while I translate that\" moire, and then said -\\nsurprisingly, in Anglic:\\n  `Kelanie A\\'liiya Camden?  You had an appointment with Ambassador\\nAouwwrr\\'lrr-Interface-to-the-Enemy this morning.  She is in at the\\nmoment if you would like to reschedule that appointment.\\'  Kelanie\\nwas surprised for a moment, and then said,\\n  `Yes... of course.  Why wasn\\'t I notified of the meeting?\\'  The\\ndatapost chewed this over for a few moments, and said,\\n  `Evidence points towards a Matter of Pride, between members of the\\nTendeysharh Embassy Staff, because you shared a berth on a\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os Transport with Ambassador Aouwwrr\\'lrr-\\nInterface-to-the-Enemy\\'s mate.  Impropriety was assumed.\\'  Kelanie\\nfrowned.\\n  `I didn\\'t touch it.  Him, whatever!  In fact, I deliberately slept\\noutside the-\\' she was cut off by a protracted yowl, which was\\ntranslated by the datapost and Kelanie\\'s notepad simultaneously.\\n  `Exactly!   Wasn\\'t my mate good enough for you?\\'  Kelanie turned to\\nsee the feline xeno that she had spotted from the cafe.  She\\n(assuming it was a `she\\') was similar in form to the Tendeysharhi\\nshe\\'d shared the berth with on the NoSan\\'No\\'Os transport; slightly\\nshorter (almost the same height as Kelanie herself); different\\nmarkings, a much furrier tail, and what appeared to be an elaborate\\ngold necklace which, on closer examination, proved to be a\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os ExoManipulator, a second set of small mechanical hands\\nwhich could be worn around the neck.  Many races here wore them,\\nparticularly those which had poor substitutes for hands, without\\nopposable thumbs.\\n  `I was supposed to contact one of your staff with regard to\\ndetailed information about the correct approach to - \\' Kelanie began,\\nand was cut off again by the Tendeysharhi.\\n  `Yes- that is me.  While this gesture is largely symbolic, it is\\nnonetheless important that it be performed properly.  Follow me.\\' The\\nfeline xeno glanced at Marek.  `That... can wait outside.\\' Kelanie\\nglanced at Marek, smiled, and said,\\n  `This is Marek Waddell, one-time owner of-\\' she was cut off yet\\nagain - Tendeysharhi seemed to like doing that - as Mrrr\\'lrr\\'s mate\\nmewed, flattening her ears, her tail lashing back and forth.\\n  `I have heard of you.  We put in a bid for that property, and were\\nout-priced by \"Keery\"...\\' her eyes narrowed to emerald slits, and she\\ngrowled, `Can you think of any reason why I should not attack you\\nright now?\\'  Marek grinned and replied,\\n  `Only that the property isn\\'t worth anything like what Keery paid\\nfor it - the previous owner is going to have it burned to the\\nground... if it hasn\\'t happened already...\\' He paused in thought.\\nKelanie was thinking along similar lines.\\n  `Do you think the explosion in the cafe was an attempt on us by\\nyour N-SVW-Tre/A?\\'  Marek shook his head.\\n  `They only hire Pthalklin Ervae for that sort of thing - they have\\none of those ninety-year contracts for mercenary work.  If I can use\\nyour data service for half an hour,\\'  Marek said to Aouwwrr\\'lrr, `I\\nthink I can bribe some Parkry and learn something.\\'  Ambassador\\nAouwwrr\\'lrr lashed her tail in a gesture of assent, took Kelanie by\\nthe hand and said,\\n  `Meanwhile, I will instruct your mate in our customs.\\'\\n\\n  She led Kelanie to a Tendeysharhi conference room, something like a\\nlarge tree turned inside-out; branches as thick as Kelanie\\'s waist\\nemerged from one wall, crossed the room and entered the other.  The\\nlight in here was a dim blue-green, from bioluminescent strips\\nembedded in the domed ceiling.  Aouwwrr\\'lrr perched on a branch about\\nthree metres from the ground, with her chin resting on her paws, and\\nregarded Kelanie with calm, feline intent.  She mewed softly, her\\nexpression tinged with soft purring trills, and Kelanie\\'s translator\\noffered:\\n  `I am a student of Primate Psychology.  I have been a student of\\nPrimate Psychology for six (years), and yet I must confess that I\\ncannot understand humans.\\'  Kelanie sat on a branch below Aouwwrr\\'lrr\\nand replied,\\n  `Feel free to ask me anything.  My position requires a knowledge\\nof, ah, primate psychology.\\' Aouwwrr\\'lrr\\'s tail flicked once, and she\\nsaid,\\n  `I believe that you came here without being given much\\njustification from your superiors.  Correct?\\'\\n  `Yes...\\'\\n  `Don\\'t you feel a need to question that?  Don\\'t you want to know\\n_why_ you\\'ve been sent here?\\'  Kelanie thought for a moment, climbed\\nup to sit with her back against the bole of a tree set into one wall,\\nthen said,\\n  `No, I don\\'t.  Most people who work for a government agency - well,\\nmost people at my level - are used to accepting unusual orders and\\nnot questioning them.  The world we work in - even, as we are,\\noccupied by the NoSan\\'No\\'Os and with most of the difficult decisions\\na government usually faces, taken from them - is very complex, and no\\none person could be expected to grasp more than a facet of the whole\\nthing.\\'  Aouwwrr\\'lrr narrowed her eyes.  Her translator said:\\n  `... and yet someone in the NoSan\\'No\\'Os manages this task.  Some\\nsingle entity somewhere must know exactly what is going on.\\'  Kelanie\\nsuddenly began to have some doubts about this mission.  She recalled\\nsomething Robyn had once told her: that in some conversations, the\\ntopics were delineated more by what was avoided than what was\\ndiscussed.  She recalled that the Tendeysharhi had once been a\\nsubject race of the Moridani, who were the dedicated enemy of the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os.  She turned to frame a very pointed question, but was\\nsurprised by a heavy thump as Aouwwrr\\'lrr leaped down to land next to\\nher on the branch.  Aouwwrr\\'lrr held up her paw, claws fully\\nextended, and said, awkwardly, in Anglic:\\n  `Race like Tendeysharhi, always listen to by \\'San\\'No\\'Os.  Careful,\\nwhen you say into translator, of what you will say.\\'  Kelanie was\\nsilent for a moment, then said,\\n  `Tell me how your mate would like to be approached for this\\noccasion.\\'  They settled down to business, discussing the\\nTendeysharhi sexual mores and customs.  Kelanie resolved to\\ninvestigate this matter further.\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n      `I\\'m His Highness\\' dog at Kew:\\n       Pray tell me Sir, whose dog are you?\\'\\n\\n              Alexander Pope, 1730\\n\\n  Marek was busily applying skills he had picked up from a childhood\\nspent on a world ruled by the innately bureaucratic Parkry; he was\\ndealing favors.\\n  `The person at this end is waiting for an opening to appear so that\\nthe person can put forward a proposal.\\'  he said in Tertiary.  The\\nlower-level Parkry official he had found to bribe manipulated a data\\nhand-set, and the reply was spelled out on the screen:\\n  THE PERSON AT THIS END OWES YOU NO FAVORS BUT WOULD BE INTERESTED\\nIN ENTERING THAT STATE - ON THE CONDITION THAT ANY RISK OR INNOVATION\\nCOULD BE MINIMISED.  Marek smiled.  He had never met a Parkry that\\nwouldn\\'t take a bribe - if it could be assured that there was little\\nchance of being caught.\\n  `The person at this end, by way of introducing the proposal, wishes\\nit to be known that it is of Human Origin; that it is proud of its\\nHuman capabilities; that Humanity is seeking to better itself through\\nbecoming a society that uses Information as a basis for exchange, for\\ncurrency.\\'\\n  THE PERSON AT THIS END, WITH TYPICALLY SUBTLE PARKRY PERCEPTION,\\nPERCEIVES THE TOPIC OF THE PROPOSAL BEFORE IT IS DESCRIBED.  HOW CAN\\nTHE PERSON AT THIS END ENRICH THE HUMAN ECONOMY?  Marek suddenly\\nasked, with uncharacteristic bluntness designed to shock the\\nbureaucrat,\\n  `Have the Militia found the ones responsible for the attack on the\\nSeff Cafe?\\'  The Parkry hunched its shoulders in surprise.\\n  THE PERSON AT THIS END IS NOT CLEARED FOR MATTERS RELATING TO THE\\nMILITIA, BUT WILL ATTEMPT TO LOCATE A PERSON THAT IS.  PLEASE WAIT.\\nMarek smiled again, hearing the Parkry\\'s favourite expression.\\nThings had certainly moved faster when he made it clear how much\\nmoney he was willing to devote to the exercise.  The bureaucrat\\nreappeared, bobbing its head when it saw that Marek was still\\nattending.  THE PERSON AT THIS END CAN REVEAL THAT THE MATTER WAS\\nTAKEN OUT OF THE MILITIA\\'S HANDS SHORTLY AFTER IT HAPPENED.  THE\\nMATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED UPWARDS.\\n  `Upwards?  From the Militia, UPWARDS?\\'\\n  THE PERSON AT THIS END BELIEVES THAT THIS IS A VERY DELICATE\\nMATTER.  THE PERSON AT THIS END BELIEVES THAT IT MAY HAVE COMPROMISED\\nITS POSITION IN FINDING THE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE.\\nIt wanted more money.  Marek went to deposit more CCI in the famous\\nbank account that was officially registered to `Marissey\\', widely\\nknown as the temporary holding ground for Parkry bribes, but the\\nbureaucrat at the other end ducked nervously, squeezing the\\ndata-handset in haste:\\n  THE PERSON AT THIS END HAS NOT COMMUNICATED EFFECTIVELY, AND WILL\\nRESORT TO HUMAN BLUNTNESS: NO MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.  THIS IS\\nWHOLLY A MILITIA MATTER.  Marek donated two by ten to the minus\\nthirteenth CCI in the account anyway, after hearing this:  the\\nincident originated with the Militia, most likely by an agent hired\\nby the Militia.  He asked,\\n  `Is it possible to speak with a Militia official?\\'  the Parkry\\ntwitched its vestigal antennae; the equivalent of a sardonic chuckle.\\nThe screen cleared and Marek found himself face to face with a\\nPlateau Bythian, wearing weapons and ammunition belts (even though it\\nwas working in an office).  It regarded him from one side of its\\nhatchet-shaped head with obvious suspicion.  Words appeared across\\nthe screen:\\n  `What do you want?\\'  Marek lied skillfully.\\n  `My lifetime-companion was injured today, in an explosion at a cafe\\ncalled `Seff\\'s\\'.  We are concerned that such events occur in a\\nsociety as... controlled... as this one.\\'  The Bythian turned from\\nthe screen for a moment; Marek could see part of a shortwave-\\nterminal as the Bythian searched a database; more words appeared.\\n  `The terrorist was apprehended, an agent of the Moridani.\\'  Of\\ncourse.  `We have a visual:\\'  a window opened on the screen and a\\npicture appeared:  the Barber.  `Do you wish to apply for a\\nGovernment Reparation Benefit?\\'\\n  `No, thank-you; the injury was minimal.\\'  The Bythian closed the\\nconnection without asking if Marek wanted to know more.\\n  Marek had never merited the attention of the Militia before; not\\neven his previous master had ever warranted interference at that\\nlevel.  This had to be something to do with Kelanie\\'s mission.  Marek\\ndecided that it would prove too expensive to probe further, also\\npolitically unsafe.  The Parkry were bribeable; the Bythians were\\nnot.\\n\\n  `Once more; you almost had it then.\\'  said Aouwwrr\\'lrr.  Kelanie\\ncomposed herself, put her head back and mewed:\\n  `Aoouw?  Aooouw?\\'  Aouwwrr\\'lrr flattened her ears, lashed her tail.\\n  `Excellent.  This should be said before the act, never during; it\\nis intended to indicate availability.\\'\\n  `Which means that once we start, then I\\'m no longer available.\\'\\nAouwwrr\\'lrr closed her eyes.\\n  `Of course.\\'  Kelanie sat back on the branch, dangling one leg over\\nthe edge, swinging it back and forth.  `Exactly how far is this\\nintended to go?  As far as consummation?\\' Aouwwrr\\'lrr mewed, flicked\\nher tail once in amused surprise.\\n  `If you want.  I won\\'t be jealous, if that\\'s what you mean.\\nTendeysharhi are used to sharing around our males.  I should caution\\nyou, though: a detail of the male\\'s generative organs may complicate\\nthings.  How are Human females structured?\\'  Kelanie removed her\\nskirt.  Aouwwrr\\'lrr examined her, prodding her cautiously with a paw,\\nand then purred.  `I foresee no major problems.  Except possibly that\\nmy mate may experience feelings of inadequacy.\\'\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n  Marek was chatting with one of the Underground Networks\\' `NAPAISub\\'\\nsimulators; in itself, very revealing that such a borderline-illegal\\nservice should be available to a datapost in what was allegedly a\\ngovernment office.  Ambassador Pr\\'rtr (Aouwwrr\\'lrr\\'s mate - `it\\nsounds like she\\'s purring when she talks about him\\', Kelanie had\\nsaid) was dividing his attention between this and toying with a\\nreplicate-lizard, which he intended to eat eventually.  Marek faced\\nthe datapost, addressing the NAPAISub simulator directly.\\n  `Okay, I want you to observe this exchange, and identify it.\\nUnderstand?\\'  The holograph animated two spheres knocking together\\ntwice, to indicate an answer in the affirmative.  Marek turned back\\nto Pr\\'rtr.\\n  `Is that a real lizard?\\'  Pr\\'rtr dangled the wriggling green shape\\nfrom one paw, flicked it with his other.  His translator replied:\\n  `Of course not.  It\\'s a genetically-engineered plant, with built-in\\nreflexes that make it behave like a lizard.  What do you think we\\nare, savages?\\'  The datapost displayed a black cube that broke apart\\ninto six pyramids and rejoined.   Marek was about to ask the datapost\\nto translate this when Kelanie and Aouwwrr\\'lrr reentered the front\\noffice.  Kelanie took Pr\\'rtr\\'s paw in her hand and led him into the\\nconference room.  Marek watched them, then glanced at Aouwwrr\\'lrr,\\nwho flicked her tail once.  He smiled.\\n\\n  In the street, order had been restored after the bombing of the\\ncafe.  The only figures that weren\\'t moving past were the two\\nBythians that had been placed on sentry duty, and the Barber, who was\\nhiding behind the remains of a truncated pillar, listening to the\\nconversation in the Tendeysharhi Embassy, through the front window,\\nusing an interferometric laser-scope.  It reached into its pouch,\\nwithdrew a metallic ovoid, and twisted a dial at one end.  It\\ngrinned, exposing rows of flat teeth.  A tongue like a rat\\'s tail\\nflickered out and back in.\\n  There was an ear-piercing yowl, and a large furry shape pounced on\\nit from somewhere above, knocking it to the ground and kicking the\\ngrenade away.  The Tendeysharhi grabbed the Barber by some loose\\nclothing at the front, and slashed at the juncture of body and head\\nwith exposed claws.   Four parallel furrows opened in the front of\\nthe Barber, spewing forth milky-looking blood.  It writhed, tongue\\nlashing about madly, scrabbling for its pouch.  The Tendeysharhi\\nslashed at its neck again, and shuddering, the Barber died.  One of\\nthe Bythians turned its flat head to one side, regarded them, and\\nturned away again.\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n       NAPAISub:  Subsystems of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os Associative\\n                  Processing Artificial Intelligence (NAPAI).\\n                  Each subsystem is individually identified by a\\n                  decimal six-figure code.  Built as part of a\\n                  project to `downscale\\' NAPAI, the original\\n                  Guidance AI of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os, to a more\\n                  manageable system and to have sub-units to\\n                  which details of minor projects could be\\n                  delegated.  Originally, only four of these\\n                  units were constructed; shortly after their\\n                  inception, rationale for more units was quickly\\n                  invented, and now there are as many NAPAISubs\\n                  as there are worlds in the Dominion.  In other\\n                  words, lots.\\n\\n                            - Foley\\'s `Unofficial Documents\\'\\n\\n  Kelanie removed her clothing and sat in the matted grass that lined\\nthe conference room floor.  Pr\\'rtr, perched on the branch nearest the\\nground, stared at her, his head cocked to one side.  She smiled up at\\nhim, remembering not to bare her teeth as she did so - the\\nTendeysharhi would take that as a threat.  Pr\\'rtr lashed his tail\\nonce.  She turned away from him, resting on her hands and knees, her\\nbare behind pointing at him, and mewed:\\n  `Aoouw?\\'  she was surprised to hear the rhythmic hissing of\\nTendeysharhi laughter.  She turned around and gave him an indignant\\nlook.\\n  `What\\'s so funny?\\'  Pr\\'rtr was clutching the branch with his claws\\nextended to keep from falling off.  A few sibilant mews emerged.\\nKelanie\\'s notepad translated:\\n  `That sound you made.  It\\'s perfect, but -\\'\\n  `But what?  Don\\'t you find me attractive?\\'  More hisses.\\n  `I suppose that you\\'re quite attractive - to another human... but\\nyou - you don\\'t have a tail!\\' Pr\\'rtr lost his grip on the branch and\\nfell into a pile of leaves at the base of the conference-room tree,\\nlanding nimbly on all fours, and then spoiling the illusion of\\nagility by rolling over on his back, hissing uncontrollably.  Kelanie\\nshifted into a sitting position and stared at him, chin on hands,\\nuntil he recovered.  Pr\\'rtr lay on his back, tail twitching from side\\nto side, arms and legs outspread.\\n  `I\\'m sorry,\\' he said at length.  `Things have been so serious\\naround here lately, what with the Moridani Infiltration and all.\\'\\nKelanie stared at him in shock.\\n  `I beg your pardon?  Are you certain that you should be saying\\nthings like that, being the Tendeysharhi Ambassador to the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os?\\'  Pr\\'rtr rolled over, lay on his stomach, resting his\\nfurry chin on his paws and levelling his cool, emerald gaze at her.\\n  `Oh, it\\'s safe... the NoSan\\'No\\'Os never monitor me; the females of\\nour race are the devious ones, the ones that the NoSan\\'No\\'Os have to\\nbe concerned about.  Us males are almost second-class citizens...\\nthat\\'s one thing the Moridani promised us they\\'d change.\\'  Kelanie\\nsmiled.\\n  `Does Aouwwrr\\'lrr know about this?\\'\\n  `Of course!  She\\'s a suffragette, you know.  In fact, she was\\nchosen by the Moridani to approach the Human Government about\\npermission to station a Moridani Partisan in the Human system.\\'\\nKelanie listened to this with a growing sense of unreality.  The\\nMoridani were universally dreaded; it only took a hint to the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os that a Moridani might be on a planet for them to blow\\nthat planet to pieces in a frantic attempt to destroy it.  It was\\nrumored that there were only twenty-three Moridani left in existence.\\nShe became aware that Pr\\'rtr was sitting next to her, anxiously\\ntapping her on the shoulder.\\n  `Miss Camden?\\'  She shook her head, sat back in the grass with her\\neyes closed.\\n  `I can\\'t believe any of this.  It\\'s too -\\'\\n  `Too?\\'\\n  ` - too extraordinary.\\'  Pr\\'rtr rubbed up against her, purring\\nreassuringly.  The sound relaxed her.  After a while, he said:\\n  `It\\'s true.  There is a Moridani Partisan hidden in our Embassy.\\nShe uses her own - interdicted - technology to hide from the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os.  She believes that your race can be helpful to the\\nMoridani Cause, and so they want to station her in your solar\\nsystem.\\'  Kelanie sat up suddenly.\\n  `I can\\'t authorise something like that!  If the NoSan\\'No\\'Os find\\nout what\\'s going on, they\\'ll drop an asteroid in our sun!\\' Pr\\'rtr\\'s\\neyes opened wide, seeming to change from a brilliant emerald to aqua.\\nKelanie\\'s notepad reproduced the serious tone of Pr\\'rtr\\'s words:\\n  `She has something important to tell you.  She didn\\'t think you\\'d\\nbelieve me, so she will tell you herself.  Do you think that Marek\\nshould be present?\\'  The sense of unreality came back, even stronger.\\n  `I do.  Actually, I really want someone to tell me that I\\'m not\\ndreaming.\\'  Unexpectedly, Pr\\'rtr butted his head against her\\nshoulder, purring.\\n  `You aren\\'t dreaming.\\'\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n  Marek and Kelanie followed Pr\\'rtr down a spiral ramp, deep into the\\nbasement of the Tendeysharhi embassy.  At the bottom, the blue-green\\nbioluminescent strips had been removed for the most part; the air was\\ndamper and even more oxygen-rich than Millimillenarian standard.\\nKelanie swallowed as her throat burned.  Pr\\'rtr approached a blank\\nwall, turned to face the two humans.\\n  `I\\'m aware that you, Marek, have spent most of your life on\\nMillimillenary, and are familiar with unusual xenoforms; and that\\nyou, Kelanie, work for the Bureau of Procuration, and that you are no\\nstranger to aliens; I want to remind you that the rumors of the\\nMoridani being bloodthirsty, maniacal killers are completely untrue,\\ndespite their appearance.\\'  Marek replied,\\n  `You can disregard anything you\\'ve heard about Humans taking\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os propaganda literally.  We know how to listen to what a\\nBureaucracy tells us.\\'  Pr\\'rtr slitted his eyes, lashed his tail and\\nturned back to face the blank wall.  It rippled and developed a\\nspiral pattern of grooves which spread out from the middle, gradually\\nerasing the wall until it had vanished completely.  Beyond it was\\ndarkness; Kelanie\\'s translator-eyepiece, viewing in the infra-red\\nrange, outlined a massive shape at the far end of the darkened room.\\nShe heard a soft murmuring sound, as if there were a group of people\\nholding a private discussion in the darkness.  Over this susurration,\\na soft voice spoke in perfectly-accented Terrestrial Anglic.\\n  `Come in, please.  My name is Tsiry-Feylen-Kendr-Tariy.\\'  Kelanie\\nstepped into the gloom with Marek following nervously behind her.\\nThe murmuring conversations were coming from the Moridani, who\\nshifted slightly, giving the impression of something with the mass of\\na large horse.  The voices diminished in volume until only the\\noccasional sibilant hiss or glottal click could be heard... with a\\npeculiar scraping sound underlying them.  Tsiry-Feylen-Kendr-Tariy\\nsmoothly rose from her crouching position, revealing her full height,\\nand moved over to a wall; an arm flexed out from her front, touched a\\ncontact, and as the light levels slowly increased, her form was\\nrevealed by degrees.  Despite herself, Kelanie drew back slightly,\\nbumping into Marek.\\n  She - Tsiry-Feylen - was shaped something like a six-legged\\ncentaur; a pair of thin, double-jointed arms mounted at the front;\\nslick grey flesh patterned in tiny scales that glittered in the faint\\nlight.  The attitude of the legs, the placing of the hooves and\\nankles hinted at an ancestor with radial symmetry, although she had a\\nhead at one end and a tail at the other.  Kelanie stood there,\\nfascinated; someone had once put forward a theory that stated that\\nintelligent life in the galaxy had, so far, been distinguished by\\nthree distinct waves, of which humanity and related races were part\\nof the third; the Moridani would have been part of the first wave.\\nTsiry-Feylen was utterly unlike anything Kelanie had seen thus far on\\nMillimillenary.\\n  The vertical mouth that divided the triangular head, mounted below\\na pair of large, diagonally-slitted eyes opened briefly, revealing\\nrows of long, needle-like teeth.  Suppressing the urge to turn and\\nrun, Kelanie realised that the Moridani was smiling at her, and that\\nthe scraping sound was the noise made by the teeth as they slid past\\none another.\\n  `Pretty nasty, eh?\\' Tsiry-Feylen said without using a translator.\\nKelanie thought that she recognised the voice.\\n  `Have we met before?\\' she enquired politely.  Tsiry-Feylen bared\\nher fangs again, bobbed her head.  She replied in a different voice,\\n  `We\\'re sure that we have...\\' - she continued in her first voice -\\n`dearest.\\'  Kelanie was certain now.  Marek looked like he was about\\nto panic and run, so Kelanie took his arm and murmured reassuringly,\\n  `It\\'s okay... she\\'s on our side.  Tsiry-Feylen, this is Marek\\nWaddell, former owner of Waddell\\'s Emporium of Extremely Fashionable\\nAttire and Quite Nice Ice Cream Parlour.\\'  Tsiry-Feylen splayed her\\nfront pair of feet slightly, bowing.  `Marek, one of these is-\\'\\n  `One of these?  How many are there?\\'  Tsiry-Feylen settled to the\\nfloor, folding up neatly like a cat, and replied,\\n  `Each Moridani has four personalities, each shared with four other\\nMoridani... although, as there aren\\'t as many of us as there used to\\nbe, this practice has declined.  Miss Camden is familiar with our\\n\"Tsiry\" aspect...\\'  Kelanie smiled.\\n  `As I was about to say; Marek, I\\'d like you to meet Robyn Starkey,\\nSection Head of the Bureau of Procuration, Syndaine office.  My\\nimmediate superior.  What I\\'d like to know is: how do you get away\\nwith it?\\'\\n  `Teleconferencing has been popular for hundreds of years.  Quite a\\nfew government officials, including humans, hold two, sometimes even\\nthree positions, under assumed names.  When they have to put in an\\nappearance, they do so by video filtered through a cosmetic graphics\\nprogram.  We rarely have time for anything fancy, image-wise, because\\napart from our partisanship, we hold two positions in the Human\\ngovernment and one in the NoSan\\'No\\'Os Bureaucracy.\\'  Kelanie looked\\naround for something to sit on, saw nothing appropriate, and settled\\nfor sitting on the floor, cross-legged.  Marek sat next to her.\\nTsiry-Feylen stared at them for a few moments; Kelanie found that she\\nhad no idea of what Moridani kinesics meant; she would have to rely\\non what she could pick up from Tsiry-Feylen\\'s voice.  `We\\'re afraid\\nthat we have some bad news for you.  The NoSan\\'No\\'Os have completed\\ntheir initial Evaluation of humanity, a study that began almost\\nninety years ago.  Our position in the NoSan\\'No\\'Os Bureaucracy has\\nallowed us to steal a copy of the preliminary recommendation.\\'\\n  `Which is?\\'\\n  `In about a month\\'s time, the NoSan\\'No\\'Os are going to drop about a\\ndozen large asteroids on Earth, followed by another thirty that will\\nbe dropped into your sun at regular intervals.  This will coincide\\nwith the arrest and subsequent termination of all free humans\\nanywhere in the NoSan\\'No\\'Os Dominion.  We must say we\\'re impressed;\\nwe haven\\'t seen a reaction this extreme since they discovered that\\nthere were a few of us Moridani still on the loose.\\' There was a\\nmoments\\' silence while they digested this.  Finally, Marek said,\\n  `Do you expect us to believe that?\\'  Tsiry-Feylen held out her\\nhands and shrugged - a very human gesture.\\n  `The choice is yours.  You have twenty-seven days.\\'  Kelanie\\ngrasped Marek\\'s hand, cleared her throat and said,\\n  `Do you have any proof?  Something tangible?\\'  Tsiry-Feylen drew a\\nsmall card made of clouded white plastic, handed it to Kelanie.\\n  `Nothing that can\\'t be easily faked.  The best way we can think to\\nconvince you is to show you the activity in your asteroid belt, where\\nthe Militia are, even as we speak, preparing the projectiles that\\nwill be - \\' Tsiry-Feylen paused, seeing Kelanie and Marek absorbed in\\nreading the documentation.  Kelanie had placed the card against her\\nnotepad\\'s scanner, which read it and translated the NoSan\\'No\\'Os\\nTertiary into Anglic.  The message was short:\\n\\n Office of Risk Evaluation:           Date: 9327685491767632151\\n Interdepartmental Action Code: AF1CF3C7F8C65E98A06ED63C87E542C\\n Authorisation:  1110011001010001001001001001001001011110101001\\n\\n NOTE TO ALL DEPARTMENTS\\n\\n    Preliminary evaluation of N-FRF-Knh/K indicates threat\\n    potential of 97.8 percent.  This is based on evidence of\\n    innate territorial habits and research into artificial\\n    intelligence which is currently in progress.  Preliminary\\n    Recommendation: level six termination, to commence\\n    immediately, pending availability of resources.  Any further\\n    enquiries can be directed to the Office of Threat Termination\\n    on Sthelanar. Work Group: T760   Cost Code : 568384\\n\\n  `You can ignore the last part; the Office of Threat Termination\\nreport all such enquiries to the Militia as a matter of course.\\'\\nTsiry-Feylen said.  Marek and Kelanie exchanged glances.\\n  `You think that Barber-xeno was after us?\\'  she murmured.\\n  `It would make sense... round up the strays...\\' Marek faced the\\nMoridani.  `Okay.  If this is all true, then what the hell can we do\\nabout it?\\'  Tsiry-Feylen\\'s mouth twitched, exposing a few glittering\\nteeth for a moment.\\n  `You could warn everyone, which would cause panic.  You could do\\nnothing, which would mean that your planet would be destroyed with\\nmost of the inhabitants still on it.  You could try mounting an\\nattack on the Bythians in your asteroid belt, which could prove\\ndifficult given your lack of spacecraft and weapons, and would most\\nlikely fail, as most attacks on Bythians do.  Or you help with what\\nis being done; get as many important people off Earth as possible and\\nhide them.\\'  Kelanie was indignant at this.\\n  `Important?  Who gets to decide who is important and who isn\\'t?\\'\\nTsiry-Feylen\\'s head swivelled to face her, eyes narrowed.\\n  `We do.  We are financing this operation.  We are hiding your\\npeople in our bases and are assuming the responsibility for making\\nsure that they remain hidden.  We are saving any humans who can\\nassist us in our war against the NoSan\\'No\\'Os.  We do not have the\\nresources to hide everyone.  We have been working on this since\\nbefore you were born, Miss Camden; we can only progress when we are\\nentirely sure that there is no risk of discovery.\\'  Kelanie felt a\\nnumbing chill settle over her as the scope of Tsiry-Feylen\\'s\\nrevelation sank in.  `We have been hiding from the NoSan\\'No\\'Os for\\nover seven thousand years; we have never exposed ourselves to the\\npossibility of discovery to the degree that we are doing at the\\nmoment.  The only reason we are doing this: we believe that humanity\\ncan, one day, help us.  Now, this is what we are going to do next...\\'\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n       `The closest a Bythian has ever come to creating a work of\\n        art or evincing a sense of humour was when the level\\n        three sub-commander in charge of the assault force on the\\n        Moridani-held world of Triple-S ordered a bomb-pattern\\n        that spelled out the words \"Up Yours, Ugly\" in Moridani\\n        Phandric.\\'\\n\\n                            - Foley\\'s `Unofficial Documents\\'\\n\\n  Three large, featureless white-metal shapes made their way down the\\ncrowded street.  The crowds parted before them, breaking on the\\nlarger of the three like water on the prow of an icebreaker, flowed\\npast the two that followed, the rift quickly healing close behind.\\n  The first shape was about the size of an elephant; it had four\\nstrong, stumpy legs at the narrow base of an inverted trapezoid\\nshape; two double-jointed mechanical arms were neatly folded at the\\nfront.  This shape moved deftly, occasionally whirling around to\\ncheck that the other two were following, utilising an involved\\nsequence of steps, turning back when it was sure that they were still\\nin tow.  They were smaller and obviously of a different species;\\nbilaterally symmetrical, two arms and legs.  Where the first shape\\nwas almost three metres from the ground to the forepeak, the others\\nwere squat shapes just under two metres tall.  One of them seemed to\\nbe unsure of the correct method of walking; it stopped with one foot\\nin the air every few steps.\\n  `Crash it, what\\'s wrong with the damn thing NOW?\\' Kelanie snarled.\\n  `You\\'re fighting it, Kelanie; try dropping force-feedback a few\\nnotches-\\'\\n  `Or turn it off altogether.  You may get tired, but it won\\'t matter\\nin the short term.\\'  Kelanie sighed, hunted for the force-feedback\\ncontrol mounted somewhere on the inner face of her land-mate battle\\nsuit and replied,\\n  `I can understand why you need a suit like this, Tsiry-Feylen; but\\nwhy the hell do we-\\'\\n  `The Bythians are probably looking for you by now.  We stand a\\nbetter chance of getting away with this if they think we are someone\\nelse.\\'\\n  `You don\\'t mean that we will have to wear these suits until we get\\nback to Earth?\\' Kelanie wailed.  She had only just become used to the\\nnew-vinyl smell of the inside of the land-mate; the spread of the\\nleg-spaces was rubbing painfully on the insides of her thighs, and\\nshe half-expected to be bow-legged when she finally divested herself\\nof the thing.\\n  `Once inside the ship and safely away, you can take them off.  We,\\nhowever, that is, we-myself, won\\'t risk exposure until we have safely\\nreached the Moridani base in the asteroids... assuming that the\\nThreat Termination team haven\\'t lobbed it into the sun... anyway, we\\nare quite comfortable in this suit.  We-myself have spent weeks at a\\nstretch in it.\\'\\n  `We-yourself are probably a couple of cans short of a six-pack.\\'\\nKelanie muttered.  Tsiry-Feylen laughed.\\n  `By your standards, we probably are.  Uh-oh - quiet, children...\\'\\nThey were passing four Bythians who were checking ID bracelets.\\nTsiry-Feylen had been able to remove Kelanie\\'s bracelet, providing a\\nsimilar one which now hung on the outside of Kelanie\\'s suit.  The\\nBythians grabbed one arm of Tsiry-Feylen\\'s armour carelessly,\\ndragging it closer to read the pattern of dots on the tag that hung\\non the leading edge of her suit.  They assumed a marginally more\\nrespectful attitude after they had read it; Tsiry-Feylen was posing\\nas an important government official.  She snatched her arm from the\\nBythian\\'s grasp, made an involved gesture with it, and the four\\nMilitia stepped aside.  They proceeded; Kelanie angled one of her\\nshoulder-boom-mounted cameras backwards and watched them.  The\\nBythians were ignoring them.\\n  `Will these disguises get us past the ExPort authority?\\' She asked.\\n  `We were hoping that you wouldn\\'t ask that.\\' Tsiry-Feylen sighed.\\n`We think so.  We have used this disguise before, and have never\\nencountered any problems.  Mind you, we didn\\'t have two pesky humans\\nin tow then.  We are prepared to fight if necessary, although small-\\narms combat with Bythians is something we\\'d rather watch on video\\nthan participate in.\\'  Kelanie\\'s suit paused, one foot in the air,\\nlagging behind Marek and Tsiry-Feylen for a moment, then catching up\\nagain.\\n  `(Damn it!) Do you think we\\'ll be in a shoot-out?  I feel like a\\nsitting duck in this thing!  Does it have any weapons?\\'  Tsiry made a\\nreproaching tsk-tsk sound.\\n  `You\\'re supposed to be a Bureau of Procuration operative, not some\\ngun-nut weapons system expert!  Your suit doesn\\'t have any energy-\\nweapons, but if you turned the force-feedback up all the way, you\\ncould easily put your fist through the side of a NoSan\\'No\\'Os\\ntransport.  That also applies to the leg-movements; with the force-\\nfeedback on full, you could leap up to a third-storey balcony, or\\njump off the roof and land safely.  So be careful.\\'  The thought of\\nbeing that strong appealed to Kelanie; when they stopped at an\\nintersection to let a line of what appeared to be Parkry children\\npass by, she started experimenting with the controls.\\n  First, she played with the response-time fine-tuning, and found\\nthat this was the cause of her suit\\'s lagging behind on some steps\\nand anticipating others.  When it was tuned properly, she could\\nalmost feel it slip into place.  She flexed the fingers in front of\\nthe shoulder-boom-mounted cameras, bent the knees.  It suddenly felt\\nlike a second skin; a feeling of energetic euphoria that she\\'d only\\nexperienced previously when absorbed in a complex gymnastic routine.\\nInside the suit, she grinned, turned the force-feedback control to\\nthe `x4\\' position and tapped her toes.  The suit responded, jumping\\nthree feet off the ground, landing on the flat, splay-toed feet, the\\nknees bending automatically to absorb the shock.\\n  `Yahooo!\\' she shouted, turning the control to the `x8\\' position and\\nleaping eight metres into the air, performing a somersault and\\nlanding on the other side of the street in a gap barely big enough to\\naccommodate the suit.\\n  `Kelanie!\\' Tsiry-Feylen froze her suit by remote control.  `If you\\nwant to draw attention to yourself, you can take all your clothes off\\nand run down the street.  Try to keep our situation in mind, please.\\'\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n  Tsiry-Feylen poked a camera-boom around the corner, scanned the\\nbroad courtyard outside the ExPort.  Two more booms, mounted on\\nKelanie\\'s and Marek\\'s suits respectively, appeared just underneath\\nTsiry-Feylen\\'s.  There were at least thirty Bythians arranged around\\nthe courtyard, and even to Kelanie\\'s untrained perception, they\\nweren\\'t merely on guard.  Someone had anticipated them.\\n  `Wait here, children... We\\'ve arranged a reception for our fascist\\nfriends - some Pthalklin Ervae - when we give the signal, we want you\\nto run straight into the ship.\\'  Even as Tsiry-Feylen spoke, Kelanie\\nsaw a movement in the decorative shrubbery arranged around the\\ntriangular doorways of the geodesic dome... then she realised that\\nthe movement wasn\\'t caused by someone hiding in the bushes; the\\nmovement _was_ the bushes.  Six plants, shaped like large agapanths,\\na central shaft topped by what appeared to be a large red pineapple,\\nmoving on round platforms that hovered a few centimetres off the\\nground, emerged from the less ambulatory shrubs.  Sharp, compressed-\\nair sounds came from within their broadly-spread leaves; half the\\nBythians fell to the ground with large holes blown through them.\\nThin yellow blood sprayed about.  The remaining Bythians immediately\\nreturned the fire, microwave weapons causing three of the plants to\\nburst into flame.  There was a massive explosion in the corner\\nnearest the Moridani and the humans; flat pieces of concrete chipped\\noff the courtyard corner wall clattered off their armour.  When\\nTsiry-Feylen dared to put a boom-camera around the corner again, she\\nsaw two of the plants nudging the bodies of the Bythians into a heap.\\nShe gestured to Kelanie and Marek and dodged nimbly around the\\ncorner.  They ran after her, pausing only briefly when she stopped to\\nconfer with the two surviving Pthalklin Ervae.\\n  Inside the ExPort building, everything had stopped at the sound of\\nthe explosion.  Parkry seated next to their dataposts regarded them\\nblankly.  Kelanie went to leap over the short barrier that laterally\\ndivided the room in two; she seemed to strike an invisible, flexible\\nbarrier and fell on her behind with a crash.\\n  `What the line-noise was THAT?\\'  Marek stumped over to help her up,\\nreached out and twanged a set of invisible wires strung over the\\nbarrier.\\n  `Monofilament.  Lucky we\\'re wearing these suits, or we\\'d be on the\\nother side - in thin slices.\\'  He walked over to the gap in the\\nbarrier, and kicked out the door.  It flew across the room and\\nembedded itself in the far wall, end first, with a short metallic\\nscreech.  The Parkry hopped back nervously as the two passed through\\nthe gap and ran up the ramp into the ship.\\n  They turned left at the first corridor inside the ship, and found\\nthemselves face-to-face with a Bythian, who was raising his weapon.\\nWithout thinking, Kelanie lashed out with one of the suit\\'s arms,\\nback-handing the Bythian flat against the wall with terrible force,\\nkilling it instantly.  She crouched to pick up the plastic gun,\\nexamined it.  It looked something like an automatic rifle, with a\\nlong rectangular magazine jammed in the base; there was nothing that\\nobviously resembled a trigger.  She shrugged within the suit and\\nbashed the gun against the starship wall, snapping the barrel.  She\\nangled the two shoulder-mounted booms forward, extended them to their\\nfull reach of two metres and tip-toed up the corridor, peeking up the\\nside corridors as they progressed.  As they approached the end of the\\ncorridor, they heard the hum of a Bythian microwave weapon, coming\\nfrom the right-hand branch of the intersection.  Immediately\\nafterwards, a grey shape flew through the air, past them and down the\\nleft-hand branch of the intersection.  A large white shape ran after\\nthe grey shape; they barely had time to recognise Tsiry-Feylen in her\\nbattle-suit.  They ran to the intersection, and saw Tsiry-Feylen\\nholding a Bythian by its legs, batting its head against the wall with\\nmeasured ferocity.  When the Bythian came apart, she dropped the\\npieces she was holding, stamped on the head with both of the\\nbattle-suit\\'s front legs, abruptly span through one hundred and\\neighty degrees and punched out a wall panel with both hands.  She\\nreached in, extracted the dented panel and tossed it over their\\nheads.  Kelanie heard a soft squelching sound, and turned a boom-\\nmounted camera back to see a Bythian, crushed against the further end\\nof the corridor behind the wall panel.  While Tsiry-Feylen was\\nworking on the machinery behind the panel, tearing cables out and\\npoking fingers into control-spaces, another Bythian appeared down the\\ncorridor, at the ship\\'s hatch.  It levelled its weapon at something\\noutside; that something slashed at the Bythian\\'s neck, severing the\\naxe-shaped head and knocking its weapon aside.  One of the Pthalklin\\nErvae hovered up the ramp and through the hatch.  The entire ship\\nshuddered, rocked; the suits\\' internal gyros keeping balance.\\nTsiry-Feylen darted between them, off down another corridor.  They\\nran after her.\\n\\n  The ship had lifted with its hatches still open; the air thinned,\\nvanishing completely when they had reached low orbit, except for the\\nroom in which they had secured the Pthalklin Ervae.  Tsiry- Feylen\\nhad been rushing from one end of the ship to the other, checking the\\nmost likely hiding places.\\n  `If there are any more Bythians, they should be dead by now. The\\nship had landed only four hours ago, so there shouldn\\'t have been\\nanyone else on board.  When we\\'ve reached our allocated departure\\npoint, we-myself will have finished searching the entire ship; we can\\nclose the hatches and refill the ship\\'s air supply from the stores.\\'\\nKelanie\\'s suit gestured to Marek.\\n  `Come on, I want to see Millimillenary from space!\\'  they stamped\\noff down the half-lit corridor while Tsiry-Feylen stalked through the\\nship, kicking service-hatches open, thrusting her camera-booms\\nrapidly in and out of the circular doors of the berths, finding\\nnothing.  There were no more Bythians on board.\\n\\n  Kelanie and Marek were leaning out of a hatch in the underside of\\nthe ship, into open space.  Below them, the golden surface of\\nMillimillenary was spread out, the faint grey gridwork of the city\\nvisible even from this altitude.  Their suit radios beeped, and\\nTsiry-Feylen said,\\n  `Heads up, children, we\\'re about to close the hatches.\\'  They\\npulled back into the corridor as the black-glass hatchway rippled\\ninto existence.  Almost immediately, their suits lost some of the\\nstiffness that came with vacuum.  They made their way back to what\\nTsiry-Feylen thought was the pilot\\'s ward-room, and when the air\\npressure was adequate, they gratefully divested themselves of the\\nbattle-suits.\\n  `Ohhh... praise \"Bob\", that\\'s a relief.\\'  said Marek, stretching.\\nTsiry-Feylen made no move to take off her suit.  Kelanie reached for\\nher toes, straightened, arched her back and wondered how Tsiry-Feylen\\ncould stand to be confined in her suit for such long periods.  The\\nMoridani spoke through an audio port mounted on the side of her suit:\\n  `We\\'re half-way home, children,  although you should both know that\\nthe most dangerous part is still ahead of us.  We\\'d like you to set\\nup a recorder on the ship\\'s communications column to monitor the\\ntrade channels.  Then go and make sure the Pthalklin Ervae is safe.\\nWe\\'ve prepared a brief knowledge-base for you, describing most of the\\ndangerous features of this ship; familiarise yourselves with it.\\'\\nShe handed them a white plastic card.  `Meanwhile, we are going to\\nspy on the enemy.\\'\\n\\n  Kelanie and Marek sat cross-legged on top of a shipping container\\nin the cargo bay, where the Pthalklin Ervae (whose name, apparently,\\nwas `Kayren-Kayley\\') had broken open about a dozen plastic bags\\nfilled with soil, and was spreading it evenly across the floor.\\n  On closer examination, the Ervae was not really an intelligent\\nplant, but rather a living hive, host to thousands of tiny insects\\nacting in communion with the plant, communicating via chemical tags.\\nIndividually, the insects were very simple; each acted out complex,\\ngenetically-programmed motions, forming the basis of an intricate\\nobject-oriented intelligence program.  Conversations - conducted\\nbetween Kelanie\\'s notepad and the plant\\'s spectrographic interpreter-\\nwere hampered by the plant\\'s slow reaction-times.\\n  `No, I don\\'t see it as a handicap,\\' Marek said, `But if your\\nspecies has such slow reflexes, then how can you effectively support\\nyourselves as mercenaries?\\'  Kelanie\\'s notepad converted his words\\ninto NoSan\\'No\\'Os Tertiary and transmitted them to the Pthalklin\\nErvae\\'s interpreter, which rendered them as a pattern of pheromones,\\nspraying at the insects that teemed in the diagonal interstices of\\nthe pineapple-shaped top.

Marek hesitated; (despite being brought up\\non Millimillenary, he was not comfortable with the idea of appearing\\nnaked before xenoforms, even Tsiry-Feylen); but only for a moment.\\n  The ship\\'s communication channels hissed faintly, the sound broken\\nby the occasional beep to indicate that the ship had passed out of\\nthe effective range of one gravitic beacon and into another.  Twice,\\na voice on the channels had spoken, in NoSan\\'No\\'Os Tertiary; Marek\\ntranslated.\\n  `They\\'re asking us if we need assistance.  They\\'ve assumed that the\\nBythians killed us.\\'\\n  `Meaning that they can\\'t accept the possibility that we killed the\\nBythians?\\'  Marek nodded.  `They\\'re more hide-bound than I thought.\\nHow they\\'ve kept hold of control for this long is a mystery to me.\\'\\nTsiry-Feylen entered, still wearing her battle suit, docilely\\nfollowed by Kayren.  She replied to Kelanie\\'s musings:\\n  `It\\'s because the situation is being handled locally, so far.  As\\nsoon as it is referred up to a Parkry that doesn\\'t mind admitting\\nthat it has no idea of what to do next, then it will become a matter\\nfor the Millimillenarian NapaiSUB and the Bythians.  That\\'s when we\\nmay be in trouble.\\'  Tsiry-Feylen stalked over to the control board,\\npoked fingers into a group of control-spaces, deactivating video\\nscreens, muting the hissing of the communication channels.  She\\ncontinued;  `We have to announce a slight change of plans, children.\\'\\nKelanie retorted,\\n  `Would you _please_ stop calling us that?\\'  Still working at the\\nranked banks of control columns, Tsiry-Feylen waved the camera-booms\\nof her suit in a manner reminiscent of the pattern used, by the\\ninsectoid Kaelen, to indicate amusement.\\n  `If you wish.  As we were saying: we will stop over at the asteroid\\nbase to visit my sister before we make for Earth.  The situation has\\nchanged slightly.\\'  Marek left off kissing Kelanie\\'s neck to ask,\\n  `When will you tell us exactly what\\'s going on?  What we will do\\nwhen we reach Earth?\\'  Tsiry-Feylen sat her suit down, the legs\\nfolding up underneath like a cat\\'s.\\n  `If we told you everything, if we gave you the statistics that\\ngovern our movements against the NoSan\\'No\\'Os, you would both probably\\nwalk out of the airlock without your suits.  Be content with knowing\\nthat you will both, most likely, be able to live out your allotted\\nlifetimes.  Which is more than can be said for the rest of humanity.\\'\\nKelanie lay back on the pile of matting, staring at the ceiling of\\nthe ward-room, and said,\\n  `I\\'ve been meaning to ask you about that, Robyn.\\'  In her suit,\\nTsiry-Feylen smiled, baring her needle teeth.  `If we are stopping\\nover on Earth, how much of a risk would it be to let a few of our\\nmost trusted friends know what\\'s going to happen, and invite them\\nonboard?  There\\'s room on this ship for at least a hundred people.\\'\\nAbruptly, Tsiry-Feylen\\'s suit cracked down the middle and opened like\\nthe two halves of a hotdog bun.  She stepped out, blinking in the\\nwatery yellow sodium light, and shook her legs in pairs.\\n  `We have no objection to that... if you would like to prepare some\\ntext mail messages - we can\\'t risk video, because even humans can tap\\ninto that - we will send them through a secure channel, after making\\nsure that the NoSan\\'No\\'Os monitors in the mail network can\\'t pick up\\non what we are doing by reading them.\\'  Kelanie was surprised.\\n  `Do you mean to say that the NoSan\\'No\\'Os manage to read ALL the\\nmail?\\' Tsiry-Feylen grinned, exposing a frightening array of dental\\nwork.\\n  `That\\'s why they have a machine monitoring it.  If it wasn\\'t for\\nthe organisational skills of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os Artificial intelligence\\nand the diligence of its sub-units, the Dominion would have collapsed\\nlong ago.\\'\\n  `How many people can we rescue?\\'  Tsiry-Feylen spread her six-\\nfingered hands in a gesture of apology.\\n  `Limit it to six or less.  We have already allocated the rest of\\nthe space for cargo; there is a lot of equipment that we have to get\\noff Earth before Threat Termination blow it.\\'  Marek glanced at\\nKelanie, and then said slowly,\\n  `That isn\\'t going to happen for six months, though, isn\\'t it?\\'\\nTsiry-Feylen spun about nimbly on her six legs, gestured to the\\nPthalklin Ervae and left without answering, followed by Kayren.\\nMarek and Kelanie glanced worriedly at each other.\\n\\n  Some twenty hours later, when Kelanie and Marek had decided to give\\nthe spherical sleeping-berths a second chance, Tsiry-Feylen raced\\npast in her battle-armour, shouting to them;\\n  `Suit up.  We have company.\\'  They disentangled themselves and\\nscrambled for the suits that were kneeling, opened like clam- shells,\\nin a corner of the ward-room.  Over the suit radios, Tsiry-Feylen\\nbrought them up to date.\\n  `The ship reentered physical-space just inside the asteroid belt as\\nexpected; what we didn\\'t count on was the entire belt being thick\\nwith Bythian scouts.  We understand that they are still preparing the\\nassault on Earth.  There\\'s a scout approaching, crew of four,\\ninforming us that it is about to dock.  We haven\\'t responded yet.\\nCome down to the lower fore airlock.\\'\\n  When they got there, Tsiry-Feylen was replacing a panel on the side\\nof the hatch, hammering the lock-bolts home with her flattened palm.\\n`We\\'re going to have to lure them out and then blow the hatch; we\\nhope the decompression will kill them all.  We want you both to back\\nup this corridor, just there, around that corner; if one of them gets\\npast, kick the stuffing out of it.\\'  Tsiry-Feylen\\'s suit crouched\\ndown directly in front of the hatch, clutching a handful of sharp\\nmetal fragments.  There was a minute\\'s silence, and then the plastic\\nof the hatchway creaked under an unfamiliar stress.  Kelanie, braced\\nagainst a data column in the passageway, poked the tip of a\\nboom-mounted camera around the corner, patching the image through to\\nMarek\\'s suit.  The black glass door of the hatch rippled away, and\\ntwo Bythians leapt through, weapons drawn.  They didn\\'t recognise\\nTsiry-Feylen\\'s crouching tank-shape for a moment; a third Bythian had\\nstepped through the hatch when the first two whipped up their guns.\\nToo late; Tsiry-Feylen flicked the fragments at them with as much\\nstrength as her suit could impart; they punched through the Bythian\\'s\\nheads and necks, embedding themselves in the wall behind them.  As\\nthe bodies collapsed, she set off the explosives that she\\'d packed\\ninto the hatchway; there was a sharp crack, and a shock-wave pushed\\nTsiry-Feylen\\'s suit back against the wall, where she grabbed hold of\\na stanchion.  The shock-wave suddenly reversed as air rushed out, the\\nhatch crackling and buzzing as it tried to cover over the enlarged\\nhole.  The scream of escaping air quickly diminished to a hiss, and\\nthen stopped as the hatch-field closed.  Tsiry-Feylen was checking an\\nexternal camera on her suit monitors; she relayed the images to\\nKelanie and Marek, who watched as the torn globe of the Bythian scout\\nship spun off into the distance; the tiny figure of the fourth\\nBythian wriggling in open vacuum, gradually becoming still.\\n\\n  Among the debris that drifted around in the trailing LaGrange point\\nof Mars was a rock, about two metres along its longest axis.\\nIndistinguishable from the other orbital rubbish, it hung there,\\napparently inert, until it decided to distinguish itself from its\\nmore sedentary companions by suddenly rotating forty degrees, aiming\\nitself at a spot somewhere in the outer fringe of the solar system.\\nAnother rock, in the leading LaGrange point, did the same.  They were\\nnow both pointing to a spot about twelve million miles above the\\nplane of the ecliptic; inside each rock, mass-sensors triangulated,\\nfixing the position of one of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os projectiles.  Satisfied\\nthat the asteroid was where it was supposed to be (although not where\\nthey would prefer it), the small but capable artificial intelligences\\nin the spy-satellites oriented on another asteroid, and another.\\nWhen they were satisfied that they had correctly placed all the known\\nthreats, they did a general half-hearted scan for any other sizable\\nobjects that weren\\'t where they should be.  Surprisingly, they found\\none, an asteroid of some two thousand and seventy tonnes that,\\naccording to their very accurate and up-to-date database, should be\\nat least two million miles further out.  Then they spotted another.\\nThen four more.  Approaching a state that could best be described as\\n`alarm\\', the two spy-satellites sent a coded signal on the gravitic\\nchannel that was, until recently, used by the NoSan\\'No\\'Os as the main\\ndata link for Earth-bound communications.  Use of this frequency\\nwould arouse the least amount of suspicion if the Bythians were\\nlistening in.  The spy-satellites knew that the intended recipient of\\nthe message would always be listening.\\n  Suddenly, faster than even electronic reflexes could allow for, the\\nspherical shape of a Bythian scout shot past, loosing a stream of\\nstone chips at high velocity, battering the spy-satellite into\\ninactivity.\\n\\n  `How many asteroids are there in the asteroid belt?\\' Marek asked.\\n  `...don\\'t know,\\' Kelanie replied absently, scanning the starfield.\\n`hundreds of thousands, I suppose... what I\\'d like to know is, where\\nare they all?\\'\\n  `We\\'ve seen your illustrations of the asteroid belt,\\' Tsiry-Feylen\\ncommented, `and we can assure you that the ratio of rocks to empty\\nspace is several magnitudes smaller than they would have us believe.\\nLike physical reality... it\\'s mostly vacuum.\\'  She stood at the\\ncontrol column, twitching fingers thrust into the control-spaces,\\nslowly rotating the ship, looking for a particular pattern of stars.\\nShe aligned a single glittering spot on the screen in front of her,\\nrotated the ship on its forward axis and drove it forward.  While one\\nhand monitored the ship\\'s velocity, the other activated the\\ncommunications system embedded inside the front of her battle suit,\\nwhich was propped open next to the control column.  Two of her voices\\nchattered rapidly, and were answered by two others from the comms\\nsystem.  Kelanie\\'s notepad could make nothing of it; the exchanges\\nwere too rapid, switching back and forth with inhuman speed.\\n  The spot on the screen that represented their destination hadn\\'t\\nchanged size appreciably; Tsiry-Feylen left off chattering for a\\nmoment, stuck all her fingers into a bank of control-spaces and said,\\n`Hang on, children.\\'  Marek grabbed Kelanie, who, having nothing\\nbetter to do, wrapped her arms around him.  The ship lurched forward,\\nspilling them backwards, over the pile of mats.  They had enough time\\nto struggle to their knees when the ship moved in a different\\ndirection, shifting from underneath them.  Kayren, mounted in a\\ncorner as unobtrusively as an office pot-plant, merely swayed\\nslightly.  Tsiry-Feylen, who had remained upright through all this,\\ngestured towards the screen.\\n  `Here we are.\\'  The screen was filled with rock-textured grey,\\nsharp black highlights slowly shifting as the asteroid rotated.\\nTsiry-Feylen made a few delicate adjustments to the ship\\'s attitude,\\nmatching spin, and then nudged it forward.  Suddenly, off to the\\nleft, the featureless asteroid face split open along seven radial\\nlines, the triangular segments folding back like flower petals.  The\\nnow-familiar white shape of a Moridani battle-suit emerged, legs\\nkicking, holding a struggling something in its arms.  The Moridani\\nkicked the shape - a Bythian in a torn pressure suit - away, the\\nreaction of which pushed the battle-suit back towards the hatch.  The\\narms extended as far as possible, scrabbling against the hatchway\\npetals.  The chattering sound came from Tsiry-Feylen\\'s suit resumed\\nbriefly.  Tsiry-Feylen sighed, and said,\\n  `It seems that Threat Termination have decided to use this asteroid\\nafter all.  Kendr-Saranaxio-Parndta-Athanasius - our dear sister -\\nhas dealt with the scouts... but Threat Termination will soon wonder\\nwhy this asteroid isn\\'t moving.

For Bythians, that is slack.\\'  Kendr-Saranaxio was\\na slightly smaller version of her sister, moving with sharp,\\nefficient grace.  She shut down the video-simulator, which she had\\nplayed like a puppet-master, transmitting a convincing portrayal of a\\nBythian scout, mimicking its phrases.  `We don\\'t think that they\\nbelieve us.\\'  Tsiry-Feylen spoke to her in rapid-fire bursts of\\nMoridani; Kendr-Saranaxio replied with a single word, which sounded\\nsomething like `fs\\'yen\\'.  Both Moridani bared their teeth in what\\nKelanie assumed were smiles.  Kendr-Saranaxio summoned her\\nbattle-suit, which walked into the docking bay of its own accord,\\nopening as it entered.\\n  `Stay here, children.  We are going to set off some fireworks.\\'\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n       ComonCurensy Isotope is another one of those annoying\\n       off-shoots of their plastics industry, according to my\\n       sources on Syndaine.

There\\'s no percentage in giving that sort of\\n       information away.\\n\\n              Aln Riker, from `Riker\\'s Defense\\', NoSaNoOs\\n              Interdiction Trial Records\\n\\n  Kelanie, Marek and Kayren were huddled together in a corner of a\\nroom adjacent to the docking bay of the Moridani base.  The humans\\nwere in their suits again; they were all listening to Kendr-\\nSaranaxio counting down to the detonation of the Bythian scout\\'s CCI\\ncharges that had been set three kilometres from the asteroid.  Marek\\nand Kelanie were discussing the ease with which they had overcome the\\nBythians so far.\\n  `I once saw a nine-hour epic video that relates to this,\\' Kelanie\\nsaid.  `It was about a world that was so inhospitable that the\\ninhabitants became natural warriors... they spread throughout the\\ngalaxy, but once they\\'d conquered everyone in sight, they\\ndeteriorated, because they lacked real opposition.\\'   Marek agreed.\\n  `The Bythians on Millimillenary were a pretty soft bunch.  You\\'d\\nhear reports of how a team of six Bythians had taken on an entire\\nplanet of dissidents and wiped them out completely; yet, there were\\nalways messages on SubVerSiveNet about how Bythians kept blowing\\ntheir feet off, because they didn\\'t know how to operate their weapons\\nproperly.\\'  A soft pinging tone indicated that Kayren had something\\nto say.  They waited politely for the translation:\\n  `The Bythian reputation is well-founded; during the Second\\nExpansion, they were ferocious, efficient and almost without regard\\nfor their safety.  It was a common technique for a Bythian to steer a\\nscout-ship, loaded with CCI charges, into the middle of a group of\\nenemy shuttles and set off the charges.  We partly attribute their\\ndecline to a lack of suitable opposition and partly to their maturity\\nas a species.  When they were created - and this was told to me by a\\nBythian just before I killed it - they felt that they had no racial\\nidentity, and thus had less to live for.\\'  Kelanie asked,\\n  `Just how powerful are these CCI charge things?\\'  Tsiry-Feylen said\\nover the radio:\\n  `Brace yourselves, children; you\\'re about to find out.\\'  There were\\nthree distant thumping sounds; echoes of the shock waves, transmitted\\nthrough the thin layer of gases that were a result of the detonation\\nof the CCI charges.  There was a pause, during which Marek said,\\n  `Well, that wasn\\'t so-\\'  and then the entire base shifted as if God\\nhad kicked it.   There was a crash as some unsecured containers fell\\nover; the entire base creaked as if it were being twisted.  Kelanie\\nfelt a ghostly acceleration inside; the base was under power, moving.\\nShe unclamped her suit from Marek\\'s, stood up and tried to open the\\ndoor to the docking bay.  It was locked.  She raised a boom-mounted\\ncamera to the small, round window mounted in the centre of the door,\\npeered through.  She could see a corner of the open gate through\\nwhich Tsiry-Feylen had steered the NoSan\\'No\\'Os ship, part of a\\nstar-field that was rolling in a dizzying fashion.  Tsiry-Feylen\\nspoke:\\n  `Okay, children, we\\'re on our way.  We will be in Earth orbit\\nwithin forty hours, unless we get stopped for exceeding the speed\\nlimit.  Kelanie, could you meet us in the garage, please?\\'  A map of\\nthe Moridani base appeared on Kelanie\\'s heads-up display, with a blue\\narrow marking the location of the garage.\\n\\n  `We have been giving some thought as to your future as a partisan.\\'\\nTsiry-Feylen and Kendr-Saranaxio were sitting on rugs woven with\\nintricate patterns in shades of grey, legs folded underneath.\\nKelanie was sitting inside the opened shell of her battle-armour,\\neyes closed.\\n  `I still don\\'t believe any of this.  I suppose that it\\'s a failing\\nof mine... I just can\\'t encompass the idea of genocide.  Human\\ngenocide, in particular.\\'  Tsiry-Feylen sent some text to Kelanie\\'s\\nheads-up display; she grabbed the eye-piece, read it; replies to her\\nmail-messages, from her friends.\\n\\n  ==========================================================\\n  kel, we\\'ll try and be there - everything has gone crazy in\\n  the past week,  the NoSan\\'No\\'Os have withdrawn completely,\\n  the  news services  have  been canceled,  there isn\\'t any\\n  fast transport available  -  we\\'ll be hitching a ride with\\n  Baralascopae,   remember him?   the ultralight enthusiast.\\n  if we can find him.  there are  all kinds  of  wild rumors\\n  flying  around,  like  the  machine-virus  one;  the  most\\n  persistent  is the one about a giant asteroid that\\'s about\\n  to hit the earth; we can\\'t check this out, because all the\\n  satellite  observatories are owned by the NoSan\\'No\\'Os.  or\\n  were.  what\\'s  going  on?  fondly  (but  nervously all the\\n  same), :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::gaeren, gen and mileva\\n  ==========================================================\\n\\n  Kelanie closed her eyes again.  Kendr-Saranaxio said,\\n  `There are two ways you can take this.  You can sit back and let it\\nhappen, pretend that there\\'s nothing you can do about it - \\' Kelanie\\nsnorted cynically.  `... or you can fight back.\\'\\n  `Is that going to save anyone?\\'\\n  `It\\'s too late for that.  We have seen this happen to six other\\ncivilisations... each time, we managed to save some of them, only to\\nwatch them submit to apathy.  We had hoped that humanity would be\\ndifferent.\\'  Kelanie sat up in her battle-suit.\\n  `I don\\'t think you understand - I\\'m not a warrior; I don\\'t know\\nanything about weapons - I\\'m a prostitute!  You,\\' pointing at\\nTsiry-Feylen, `pretending to be Robyn, you assigned me to\\nMillimillenary - why me?  Why not a weapons specialist, why not\\nsomeone who could do a better job of attacking the NoSan\\'No\\'Os?\\'\\n  `Human weapons specialists no longer exist.  The NoSan\\'No\\'Os\\nproscribed human weapons research.  In our limited capability with\\nthe Bureau of Procuration, we checked everyone that we could for the\\nqualities that we need.  You came out on top.\\'  Kelanie sneered,\\nfalling back into the suit.\\n  `Oh, I\\'m sure that the ability to deliver a good blow-job is\\nessential to partisanship.\\'  Tsiry-Feylen bared her teeth.\\n  `The qualities we are looking for include adaptability, quick\\nreflexes and a willingness to believe that the impossible can, at\\nleast, be attempted.\\'  She got up, padded over to the side of\\nKelanie\\'s suit.  `We once found a human weapon specialist... he was\\none of the first people to travel off-world when the NoSan\\'No\\'Os\\narrived.  He had definite ideas about what could be done and what\\ncouldn\\'t, and he had no inclination to change those ideas or broaden\\nhis horizons.\\'\\n  `What happened to him?\\'\\n  `He joined a group of Pthalklin Ervae on Copperla, and a Bythian\\nkilled him.  The point is, while he knew a great deal about military\\nmatters, his knowledge got in the way - he couldn\\'t conceive of\\nbattles fought with asteroids, for example, and he refused to even\\nconsider the one thing that the NoSan\\'No\\'Os fear above all.\\'  Kelanie\\nopened her eyes.\\n  `Which is?\\'  Tsiry-Feylen held up the video-eyepiece which had been\\nconnected to Kelanie\\'s notepad.  `Biological augmentation.\\nMan-machine interfaces.  Do you recall the first thing that the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os did when they arrived?\\'\\n  `After taking over and disassembling our nuclear capability, they\\nlaid down guidelines for acceptable research, warning us that if we\\nstepped outside those guidelines, they would be reinforced with a\\nshow of military strength.\\'\\n  `And at the top of the list of prohibited technology?\\'\\n  `Artificial intelligence.

Virtual reality.\\nBiological modification.\\'\\n  `- and the NoSan\\'No\\'Os believe that humans, even unmodified, are\\nsuch a threat that you have to be wiped out completely.  Can you see\\nthat they fear you almost as much as they fear us?  That you have the\\npotential to undermine them?\\'  Kendr-Saranaxio added something in\\nMoridani, which inspired a brief argument between the two xenoforms.\\nKelanie sighed, closed her suit and turned off the cameras.\\n\\n  Kelanie was in the control room of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os Freighter that\\nthey\\'d hijacked, examining the mass of control-spaces that made up\\nthe communications panel.  She had read everything that\\nTsiry-Feylen\\'s knowledge-base had to say on the operation of\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os equipment, and she thought that she could operate the\\ncomms system without Tsiry-Feylen finding out.  She looked over her\\nnotes again, rehearsed the patterns, and then tentatively poked her\\nfingers into four holes, one after the other.  Nothing obvious\\nhappened; she poked a finger and a thumb into the NoSan\\'No\\'Os\\nequivalent of the `enter\\' key and the main monitor came to life,\\nhissing with vertical streaks of video static.\\n  There were six particular control-spaces underneath the monitor\\nthat were concerned with adjusting the frequency of the receiver.\\nShe played with these for a few minutes, before discovering that they\\nonly altered the frequency over several pre-set channels, none of\\nwhich were used by the Earth contingent of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os.  She\\nlooked at her notes again, found a reference to a `global frequency\\nunlock\\', activated it.  Now, (apparently), the six control-spaces\\nunderneath the monitor would range up and down the nano-gravitic\\nband, the two outside holes changing the frequency rapidly; the\\ninnermost holes fine-tuning it.  She was so absorbed in this that she\\ndidn\\'t notice Kayren glide up behind her.  The Pthalklin Ervae\\nwatched over her shoulder as she searched through the available\\nfrequencies for any signal from Earth.  She found a few channels\\nsaturated with red and green vertical stripes, which she recognised\\nas encoded Bythian military transmissions; finally, towards the upper\\nend of the frequencies that the Freighter could receive, she found a\\nband without noise, which meant that a signal was being transmitted\\non that frequency.  A synthesised voice was counting down, in\\nTertiary, from somewhere around sixty-one thousand, speaking every\\ntwo minutes or so.  A few rapid calculations revealed that, if this\\nwas a countdown to the asteroids\\' impact on Earth, they had\\nthirty-four hours left.  She jumped nervously as Kayren pushed past\\nher, moving closer to the control panel.\\n  `Like this, Kelanie...\\' Kayren\\'s translator said.  Three insects-\\neach about the size of Kelanie\\'s thumb - floated up to the columns,\\ndarting in and out of the control-spaces, occasionally flying back to\\nthe leaf-platforms that were arranged in a fringe just below Kayren\\'s\\npineapple-shaped head to pick up new pheromonal instructions then\\nflying up to execute them.  The hissing of the untuned videoscreen\\ncleared, revealing a two-dimensional display, red Tertiary text\\nagainst a black background.  Kelanie lifted her video-eyepatch,\\nwatched as the words blurred and resolved into the Anglic\\ntranslation:\\n\\n               This is a NoSan\\'No\\'Os announcement.\\n       The service you are calling has been discontinued\\n           due to a breach of the Interdiction laws.\\n\\n  `That is the primary data exchange channel from Earth.\\' Kayren\\nexplained.\\n  `It was.\\'\\n\\n  Kelanie was in her battle-suit, drifting alongside the NoSan\\'No\\'Os\\nFreighter bolted to the outside of the Moridani base, floating a few\\nmetres from the hatchway which Tsiry-Feylen had blasted, tethered by\\na thin plastic cable.  She had gone outside primarily to get away\\nfrom the others, to try and sort out what was going on.  From what\\nshe had seen, Tsiry-Feylen wasn\\'t deceiving her about the imminent\\ndestruction of humanity.  What could she do about it?  Ninety years\\nof existence under the rule of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os had convinced mankind\\nof the futility of opposition.  The only thing she could think to do\\nwas to warn the government - what was left of it - somehow.  She\\nheard a tactful `click\\' over her suit phones as Marek drifted out of\\nthe hatch to join her.\\n  `Come back inside, Kelanie.  I feel nervous with you floating\\naround out here.\\'  She reached over and took his suit\\'s hand in hers,\\ntugged gently on the tether with her other hand, bouncing off the\\nedge of the hatch as they passed through it.  The black glass formed\\nbehind them as they settled to the deck; air rushed in through vents\\nranked along the bottom of the walls.  Marek opened his suit, climbed\\nout after activating a sequence that would command it to walk back to\\nthe docking bay by itself.  The suit snapped shut, shuffled around\\nthem both and moved off.  Kelanie, still in her suit, followed Marek\\nback to the berth that they\\'d shared on the journey to the asteroid\\nbase.  She stopped outside the round doorway, still lost in thought.\\nMarek knocked on the front of her suit.\\n  `Come on out... I know you\\'re in there somewhere.\\'  Abruptly, the\\nsuit opened, and Marek reached in, unbuckling the securing straps,\\nlifting her out of the suit, trailing monitor leads and cables.  One\\nby one, he carefully peeled the contacts from her skin, kissing the\\nplaces where they had been attached.  She hugged him, one arm around\\nhis neck, running her hand down his back with sudden desperation,\\nkissing him and dragging him into the berth, tears beginning to leak\\nfrom beneath her tightly-closed eyelids.  Her hand brushed the keys\\nof her notepad, which began to play some soft ambient music, all\\ncrashing ocean waves, whale song and distant bass tones, as Marek\\nstroked open the contact strip that held the front of her jumper\\ntogether, pushing it aside, kissing her breasts and throat.  She lay\\nback on the mats which Marek had been sleeping on, breathing deeply,\\nbiting her lip from the effort of suppressing the despair she felt.\\n  Three large insects zipped into the room, circled over the entwined\\npair, and, scenting the pheromones, flew out again.\\n\\n  Tsiry-Feylen was silent as she wiggled her fingers in the control-\\nspaces on the flight-column of the NoSan\\'No\\'Os freighter, which\\nturned, backed away from the asteroid (which was still heading\\ndirectly towards Earth), swung around it and overtook it.  Kelanie,\\nMarek and Kayren stood behind her, watching the view in front of the\\nship displayed on the main screen.\\n  Kendr-Saranaxio entered, wearing a battle-suit, Kayren swaying\\nslightly to avoid the rhinoceros-sized mass as it passed.  The suit\\ncracked open, and Kendr-Saranaxio stepped out, shaking her legs.  She\\nsaid, using two of her voices,\\n  `We are taking a great risk...\\' `but we have decided to use\\nthree-quarters of our offensive potential to divert as many asteroids\\nas we can get away with.\\' `There are three more stolen freighters\\narriving from other parts of the galaxy;\\' `We intend to lift as many\\nhumans off Earth as we can,\\' `...before the Bythians can retaliate.\\'\\n`We are going in first, though, to pick up the cargo we originally\\nintended to.\\'  Marek asked,\\n  `Weapons?  I didn\\'t think that humanity had any.\\'  Kendr-Saranaxio\\nbared her teeth at him; he grinned back.\\n  `We have been stockpiling CCI missiles on Earth for the past nine\\nyears, but we aren\\'t going in for them;\\' `We have also been\\nstockpiling information; history, music, art, that sort of thing.\\nThat stockpile is our primary concern.\\'  Tsiry-Feylen said, tersely,\\nin Bythian;\\n  `Yl chuev chto ty valyf, li svayen\\'e valyf.\\'  Kendr-Saranaxio\\nreplied,\\n  `If it is a mistake, we don\\'t think that there will be time to feel\\nembarrassed about it.\\'  She turned to the two humans and said,\\napologetically,  `My sister has been living safely on Millimillenary\\nfor so long that she has lost her sense of adventure.\\'  Tsiry-Feylen\\nretorted sardonically,\\n  `My sister has been out gun-running in the asteroids for so long\\nthat she has lost her sense of proportion with regard to risk-\\nevaluation.\\'  Kendr-Saranaxio held up a hand, extended one finger\\nthen another, withdrawing them both; the Kaelen antennae-signal that\\nrepresented amusement.  Tsiry-Feylen activated a bank of six monitors\\nto her left, screens filled with vertically-run static that faded to\\nreveal views along the side of the Freighter.  Tsiry-Feylen\\nexplained,\\n  `Missiles.  We will send them ahead of us, in case there are any\\nBythians lurking around.  We will leave them in orbit while we go\\ndown for the cargo.\\'  Each view shuddered and changed in turn as the\\nmissiles were launched, accelerating furiously, the bright star that\\nwas their destination swelling appreciably as they watched.\\nKendr-Saranaxio said,\\n  `You humans can feel proud of those missiles; the drives were\\nstolen from the NoSan\\'No\\'Os, as were the CCI warheads, but control\\nfor each missile is provided by prototype artificial intelligences,\\ndeveloped on Earth.\\' `...so you can begin to understand why the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os fear you... would you like to chat with a missile?\\'\\nKelanie, relieved that something was going to be done to avert the\\nholocaust that she still couldn\\'t encompass, grinned at Marek.\\n  `What can you say to a missile?  Good-bye?\\'\\n\\n           *           *           *           *           *\\n\\n           How to: Show a Kaelen that you appreciate the joke it\\n                   told you\\n\\n        If you don\\'t have antennae, use your fingers.  It isn\\'t\\n        necessary to hold them up next to your temples; make a\\n        fist, extend your index finger, then extend your little\\n        finger while withdrawing the index finger; then withdraw\\n        the little finger into your fist again.  A significant\\n        delay between the index and little finger movements is\\n        interpreted as sarcasm, so be careful.\\n\\n                    - `Let\\'s Speak Kaelen\\', Chapter One\\n\\n  The ExPort appeared deserted.  A scrap of paper blew out of one of\\nthe gaping hangar doors, across the concrete oval of the landing pad.\\nIt fluttered, and then was swept aside as the NoSan\\'No\\'Os freighter\\nsettled to the pad as softly as a balloon.  A ramp extruded from the\\npad, extending upwards to the hatch that opened just as the ramp\\nreached the ship.  Two Moridani battle-suits ran down the ramp,\\nacross the ExPort and into the hangar, followed by two smaller\\nbattle-suits.\\n  `They\\'re not here yet!\\'  Kelanie scanned with her boom-mounted\\ncameras, moving aside as Tsiry-Feylen ran out of the hangar, followed\\nby six crates that floated ten centimetres off the ground.  Kelanie\\nmoved into the hangar, which looked like it had been the subject of a\\nraid conducted by heavy earth-moving gear; cubicles and desks pushed\\nover to one side of the building, two gaping holes in the back wall.\\nCrates were piled conspicuously in the bare centre of the floor.\\nKendr-Saranaxio was darting from one crate to another, checking\\nlabels, occasionally slapping a crate on the side.  When she did\\nthis, the crate lifted from the ground and floated towards one of the\\nholes in the back wall.  Curious, Kelanie walked around to the rear\\nof the hangar, and watched in fascination as the crates floated in\\nsingle file to a landing pad, where they popped open, revealing a\\nwhite metal sphere about a metre in diameter.  The spheres rotated,\\naligning themselves with some invisible signal, and then shot off\\ninto the sky.  Faint thunder of a series of distant sonic booms\\nsounded from above.  The last of the spheres executed an impossibly\\nsharp right-angle turn just after it launched, darting off behind\\nKelanie.  She turned, and seeing a distant speck in the sky,\\nincreased the magnification of her suit camera.\\n  It couldn\\'t be a NoSan\\'No\\'Os craft; it was moving too slowly.  It\\nresembled a bus, painted in camouflage green and brown, with two hazy\\ncircles wavering over each end.  The sphere shot towards the machine,\\ntaking up a position underneath it.  Kelanie ran back to the hangar,\\nwhere Kendr-Saranaxio was giving loading instructions to the crates.\\n  `Someone\\'s coming - I think it might be my friends.\\'  Kendr-\\nSaranaxio slapped the last crate, which lifted, spun around and\\nfloated off towards the freighter.\\n  `According to the telemetry from the missile, it\\'s an antique\\nhelicopter, human technology, three people on board.  It has only\\nshortwave electronic radio, which we don\\'t have transceivers for.\\'\\nShe ran back outside, to where Marek\\'s suit stood open.  Marek angled\\nthe suit back, staring at the sky, wrinkling his nose in distaste.\\n  `This air smells funny.\\'  he said.  She beckoned to him as the\\nhelicopter approached, dipping unevenly towards the grass next to the\\nfreighter.  The rear rotor cut out completely, dropping the machine\\nto the ground from a height of about three meters, the chassis\\ncrumpling slightly as it hit.  Marek snapped his suit shut and\\nKelanie ducked as the \\'copter tilted over on one side, the rotors\\nchopping into the ground, snapping off and flying in all directions,\\nthe craft shaking like an animal in the throes of some haemotoxic\\npoison.  When it had finally settled, the rear of the machine opened\\nhaltingly, then broke off.  Three figures jumped out, freezing when\\nthey saw the battle-suits approaching.  Kelanie shouted through her\\nsuit\\'s external speaker,\\n  `Gen?  Gaeren?\\'\\n\\n  Some ninety thousand kilometres away, a Bythian scout flew a\\nparallel course to a roughly egg-shaped, nickel-iron asteroid,\\nthirty-two kilometres along its longitudinal axis, turning\\nend-over-end once every twenty-one minutes.  Occasionally, the\\nBythian navigator glanced over the radar display, not expecting to\\nsee anything, but keeping watch all the same.\\n  Suddenly, it spotted three blips on the extreme edge of the radar\\nfield.  At the next sweep, there were fifteen blips.  It didn\\'t waste\\nany time; it thrust fingers into control-spaces, launching a volley\\nof missiles, each no larger than a football, designed simply to get\\nin front of a target and disintegrate, leaving a cluster of debris\\nmoving at high speed.  As soon as the missiles were away, the blips\\nscattered, changing course with a smoothness only possible for ships\\ndriven by NoSan\\'No\\'Os impeller engines.  The Bythian immediately sent\\nan alarm to Threat Termination Control, but before it could specify\\nthe nature of the problem, the first blip had arrived at its\\ndestination, directly between the asteroid and the scout.  It paused\\nthere for a moment, and the Navigator considered lobbing some more\\nmissiles at it when it vanished in a pinpoint of white light, a flare\\nof vaporised rock spreading out from the leading shoulder of the\\nasteroid.  The navigator didn\\'t bother throwing its arms up in front\\nof its face, which would have been a useless gesture; its last act\\nwas to launch all its missiles in the general direction of the line\\nof blips; three projectiles made it out of the scout\\'s launching bay\\nbefore a hail of asteroid-fragments riddled the ship, tearing it to\\npieces.  The Bythian didn\\'t survive to see the other fourteen blips\\nreach their target and detonate, each pushing the asteroid several\\ndegrees off its course.\\n\\n\\n      `Remember: military targets only! Be sure you hit nothing\\n       except bases, dumps, roads, factories, bridges, trains,\\n       ships, houses, fields, forests, buildings, vehicles, or\\n       anything else that may look suspicious.\\'\\n                       - Handelsman\\n\\n  Tsiry-Feylen was in the freighter, talking with two other Moridani\\nwho were on their way to Earth.\\n  `It\\'s going to be a <nightmare>,\\' she said with a degree of\\ndisgust.  `Kendr-Saranaxio is getting sentimental... anyway, it\\nappears that there are almost twice as many asteroids as we accounted\\nfor, so by the time you get here, the planet will be a disaster\\narea... the system will be swarming with Bythians... we\\'re tempted to\\ncut and run.\\'\\n  `The first wave of diversion-missiles will have reached their\\ntargets by now; what is the latest projection with regards to Threat\\nTermination finding out what\\'s going on?\\'  Tsiry-Feylen transmitted a\\ncomplex, four-dimensional data-structure, showing how many of the\\neight hundred and ten scouts nurse-maiding the projectiles were\\nexpected to survive the detonation of the diversion-missiles and what\\nthe chances were of any of the survivors being able to report.\\n  `We agree... it *_is_* going to be a <nightmare>.  We will have to\\narrange temporary living quarters for, how many?\\' `eleven hundred.\\'\\n`eleven hundred humans, on Triple-S and Beckett.  We can\\'t see that\\nmany humans co-existing peacefully inside NoSan\\'No\\'Os freighters for\\nmore than a <week>.\\'  Tsiry-Feylen narrowed her eyes, grinning.\\n  `Maybe that is just what we need.\\'  She closed the connection,\\ninstructed her suit to take her outside, to check on the cargo\\nloading.  She saw the five humans sitting on the edge of the loading\\nramp, and waved as she passed, grinning to herself when she saw the\\nlooks of surprise on the faces of Kelanie\\'s friends.\\n  Kelanie had been fielding their questions, assisted by Marek and\\nthe odd comment thrown in by Kendr-Saranaxio as she ran past, herding\\ncrates into the freighter.  Gaeren Tuuri, a tall, thin neuter who had\\nworked with Kelanie in the Bureau of Procuration, was describing the\\nchaos that the NoSan\\'No\\'Os withdrawal had produced.\\n  `It was like a mob of children who\\'d just been let out of school...\\nwhat surprised me was the number of murders that occurred; you don\\'t\\nrealise just how violent most people are underneath the thin veneer\\nof civilisation...\\' he shuddered.  Genesis, one of Kelanie\\'s\\nassociates from her days in the `AnarchArtist\\' Terrorist/ Absurdist\\norganisation, was scanning through the notes she\\'d collected during\\nher stay on Millimillenary.  He\\'d found a picture of the\\nBythian-hired assassin, the one they\\'d called the `Barber\\'.\\n  `This... up until three weeks ago, there were dozens of these Xenos\\nall over the place, accompanied by squads of Bythians.\\'  Mileva\\nBarker, ex-AV thief and street-gang leader, had taken a liking to\\nMarek; Kelanie felt obliged to warn her, in low-level street talk, to\\nbe careful with him, `... or else you will have me to answer to.\\'\\n  Tsiry-Feylen noted that the Hangar was now empty; she turned back\\nto the ship, stopping at the ramp and opening up her suit.  She\\nresisted the impulse to bare her teeth at Kelanie\\'s friends.\\n  `Unless you are expecting anyone else, we should go.  It appears\\nthat we haven\\'t been one hundred percent successful in stopping the\\nasteroids, and our best estimates give us less than half an hour to\\nget clear.  We have successfully diverted approximately six hundred\\nand fifty of the eight hundred and ten projectiles; the remaining few\\nhave been blown off course, but we can\\'t be sure exactly where\\nthey\\'ll land until they enter the atmosphere, because the Bythian\\nscouts that survived the attacks have been trying to push them back\\non course.\\'  Kendr-Saranaxio joined them, opening her suit (and\\nscaring Mileva by grinning broadly, scraping her teeth together and\\nproducing the sound which Kelanie had once compared to that of knives\\nbeing sharpened).\\n  `Baylal-Delvoy-Kendr-Teff reports that there are some military\\ntransports on their way from Bythe Prime...\\' `... and you can believe\\nthat they aren\\'t just stopping by to say \"hello\"...\\' `we have\\nallocated the rest of the diversion-missiles to targeting the\\nremaining scouts, so, with a degree of luck, all the asteroids will\\nmiss Earth, giving us enough time to get as many people off as we can\\nfit into two NoSan\\'No\\'Os freighters.\\'  Kelanie said,\\n  `Didn\\'t you say that there were three freighters on their way?\\'\\nKendr-Saranaxio narrowed her eyes, abruptly closed her suit and ran\\nup the ramp into the ship.  Tsiry-Feylen hissed, exposing her fangs,\\nthe hands of her suit clenching and unclenching, and then turned to\\nrun after Kendr-Saranaxio.  There was a moment of embarrassed\\nsilence.  Marek hefted the case of hand-weapons which Mileva had\\nstolen from the museum (in which they\\'d found the helicopter), and\\nstarted up the ramp after the two Moridani.\\n  `Come on.\\'  Kelanie, the last one up the ramp, paused in the\\nhatchway and turned to look at the ExPort one last time.  A twinkling\\nlight far off in the sky caught her attention; she closed her suit,\\naimed a boom-mounted camera in the general direction of the light,\\nmagnified the view.  It appeared to be moving downwards slowly and as\\nshe watched, glowing fragments broke off and spun away.  She blew\\ninto the voice-activated microphone, and said,\\n  `Tsiry-Feylen?  Can you see that object in the sky to the east of\\nus?\\'  There was a pause, after which the ramp fell away and the hatch\\nclosed, almost chopping off the end of Kelanie\\'s boom-mounted camera.\\nShe stumbled back slightly as the ship lifted.\\n  `Kelanie, secure yourself... we have a projectile coming in on us.\\'\\nTsiry-Feylen said.\\n  `An asteroid?\\'  She instructed her suit to run back to the\\nfreighter\\'s control room, passing her friends on the way there, while\\nshe tried to find an external camera that could show her the\\nprojectile in any detail.  She could hear fragments of conversation,\\nthe choppiness of the voice-activated microphones becoming annoyingly\\nobvious as she tried to filter some meaning out of the words:\\n  `-primary diversion was successful, at least it\\'s not going to hit\\nthe residential area-\\'\\n  `-ing thing IS going to hit US, though, if we don\\'t get moving NOW!\\nKelanie, are you secured?\\'  She halted her suit\\'s headlong rush,\\nthrew herself down to lie spread-eagled on the floor, hands and feet\\nlocking against the sides of the corridor.\\n  `Yes, I\\'m secure - what\\'s going to -\\'  She heard a thump, which,\\neven through the walls of the ship, was obviously somewhere below\\nthem, followed by a jarring blow which hit her in the stomach as the\\nship was buffeted by the strike.  Had she been standing at the time,\\nshe would have ended up at the far end of the corridor in a heap. The\\nship rocked like a leaf over a bonfire as she scrambled to her feet,\\nstumbling down the passage.\\n  In the control room, her friends were clustered in a corner, while\\nthe two Moridani stood at the control columns, busily directing their\\ndwindling supply of intelligent missiles towards their targets.  One\\nof Tsiry-Feylen\\'s component personalities took the time to inform\\nthem:\\n  `It looks bad, children - the NAPAIsub for this system caught on to\\nus quickly... they are definitely worried about you.\\'  Kelanie, still\\nin her suit, went to a column off to one side, out of the Moridani\\'s\\nway.  She patched her suit\\'s display into the control column and\\nsorted through the various views available from outside monitors,\\neventually finding one that showed the Earth below them.  There was a\\nturbulent grey field of cloud directly underneath them where the\\nasteroid had hit.  Her eyes widened as two more projectiles passed\\nby, on parallel courses, glowing an angry red colour; one of them\\nless than fifty metres from the ship.  Something zipped across the\\nscreen, curving to track the nearer of the two asteroids, which were\\ndwindling rapidly in the distance.  There was an intense white flare,\\nmomentarily rendering everything in stark black shadows; when it had\\nfaded, the first asteroid, chunks breaking away, was drifting towards\\nits companion.  As Kelanie increased the magnification to keep them\\nin view, they collided, the first asteroid breaking up into four\\nsmaller pieces, the second pushed off course.  She opened her suit,\\nsitting it down on its knees, staring at the screen as it tracked the\\nasteroid until it hit, on the edge of the residential block about\\nfive kilometres from the ExPort.  The view, which was already heavily\\naliased due to the extreme magnification, became completely obscured\\nby dust, but she knew that anyone in that part of residential block\\nwould be dead.  She looked up at Tsiry-Feylen, despairingly.\\n  `Isn\\'t there anything we can do?\\'  Tsiry-Feylen kept flicking her\\nfingers in and out of the control-spaces, and replied tersely,\\n  `There is, and we are doing it.  If you would like to help, go down\\nto the secondary cargo bay and look for a crate marked \"vayasch\\ncheyr\".  We\\'d hate to think that it got left behind.\\'\\n\\n\\n <######> requesting connection    ............\\n         connection established    connection established\\n\\n                                   who is this?  identify yourself!\\n we have a data packet for you.\\n                                   repeat, identify yourself!\\n                                   look, i can\\'t accept this data\\n                 (transmitting)    without identif - oh, all right,\\n                                   receiving...

The humans sat in the cargo bay and watched as the Pthalklin\\nErvae expertly adjusted a multi-screen holographic display, the views\\nchanging every thirty seconds.   Most of them were incomprehensible;\\nsome were streaked with the dot-patterns that the Moridani used for\\ntelemetry; others were blank, or obscured by static.  Whenever they\\nfound an interesting view, they froze the display on that channel\\nuntil the missile that was sending it was destroyed.  Kelanie sat\\nbehind the others, in her battle suit, her hands clenched around the\\ngrips of the hand-manipulator controls.  They were getting a\\nfragmentary view of the carnage that the Moridani had been unable to\\nprevent; huge chunks of rock ploughing into heavily-populated centres\\nwith the strength of atomic weapons, the shock waves knocking\\nbuildings flat in circles for kilometres around.  She tried to treat\\nit like some sort of documentary special-effect, but it didn\\'t make\\nher feel any better.  After watching the eighth or ninth city being\\ndemolished, she slammed her suit shut and stamped out.  Momentarily,\\nMarek turned as if to follow her, but couldn\\'t think of anything\\nreassuring to say, and instead folded himself up behind a crate, his\\nhead in his hands.\\n\\n  When she got to the control room, both Moridani were motionless,\\nwatching a single monitor on which telemetry information flashed past\\nat a rate too fast for her translator to even register.\\n  `Tsiry-Feylen?  What\\'s happening?\\'  No answer.  She walked her suit\\nover to stand between the xenos, opened it.  Their attention didn\\'t\\nwaver.  Kelanie sat in her suit, trying for a minute to decide\\nwhether interrupt them.  She was about to speak again when both\\nturned sharply to look at each other, baring their teeth and hissing;\\na display that almost made Kelanie\\'s hair stand on end.\\nKendr-Saranaxio stretched, shaking her rear legs, and Tsiry-Feylen\\nsaid,\\n  `We think we may have just halted Earth\\'s NAPAISub.  If we have\\nsucceeded, then we stand a chance of getting those nine hundred\\npeople off Earth safely.\\'  Kendr-Saranaxio opened a communications\\nchannel to one of the other stolen NoSan\\'No\\'Os freighters, began\\nchatting with another Moridani.  Tsiry-Feylen took Kelanie aside, sat\\non one of their grey patterned rugs, her legs folding neatly\\nunderneath.   `We gravely underestimated the importance that the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os placed on your extermination.  We had been monitoring the\\ncommunications between the NAPAISubs, but it appears that this\\nexercise was planned privately between the local NAPAISub and NAPAI.\\nWe have managed to get both freighters down on Earth and fully\\nloaded... we are now waiting for an opening before we can lift them\\nto safety.\\'  Kelanie felt an ache behind her eyes, matched by a\\nnervous feeling in her stomach, as if she were about to perform on\\nstage in front of thousands of people.  Tsiry-Feylen was watching her\\nclosely.  Kelanie said in a small voice,\\n  `You\\'ve seen this happen before, haven\\'t you?\\'\\n  `Six times.  This is the third time we\\'ve been involved in an\\nrescue.  We have some idea of the anguish you are experiencing.\\'\\nKelanie closed her eyes as the feeling got worse.  `We don\\'t cry, but\\nif we could, we would.\\'  The semi-nauseous feeling vanished, abruptly\\nreplaced by anger.\\n  `I would have thought that you\\'d be used to it by now.\\'  she\\nsneered.  Tsiry-Feylen raised an index finger in warning.\\n  `We had friends on Earth, too.  Don\\'t, for one minute, think that\\nyou have some sort of monopoly on grief around here.  Start to think\\nthat when you have seen this game played out a few more times, when\\nyou have seen more sentient beings killed than you thought existed.\\nStart to think that when the NoSan\\'No\\'Os are hunting for you,\\npersonally, and will kill anyone who gets in their way to find you.\\nStart to think that when you find that you cannot trust anyone, or\\nbefriend anyone, for fear that they will be killed by the\\nNoSan\\'No\\'Os.\\'  Kelanie stared up at the alien for a moment, then\\nbroke the contact by abruptly shutting her suit and running off down\\nthe corridor.\\n\\n  She found herself in the corridor where she had back-handed the\\nBythian, almost severing its head.  She opened her suit, undid the\\nsecuring straps and stood up in it, bringing her head level with a\\nyellow stain on the white ceramic wall.  Bythian blood.  She reached\\nout and ran her fingers over it, idly scraping some of it off with\\nher fingernails.  She heard someone - Marek, judging from the sound\\nof his bare feet - approaching.  She laid her hand flat against the\\nwall, turned to face him.  In the short time that he had known her,\\nMarek had never seen her with an expression like the one she\\npresented now.  It was a look that conveyed icy, relentless resolve;\\nthe look of obsession.\\n  `We will give them good reason to fear us.\\' she said.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis file is Copyright (c) Nikolai Kingsley, 1995.
